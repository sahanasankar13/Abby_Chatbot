      "content": "Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy. It can be performed in two main ways: 1. **Medical Abortion**: This involves taking medications to end a pregnancy and is typically available up to 10 weeks into the pregnancy. 2. **Surgical Abortion**: This includes procedures such as vacuum aspiration and dilation and evacuation (D&E), which are performed by a healthcare provider. The safety and availability of abortion services can vary significantly depending on local laws and regulations (SOURCE [kb_004]). If you're also curious about birth control, it refers to methods used to prevent pregnancy. There are various types of birth control, including hormonal methods (like pills, patches, and IUDs), barrier methods (like condoms), and natural methods (like tracking ovulation). Each method has different effectiveness rates, side effects, and suitability depending on individual health needs. If you have more specific questions or need personalized advice, I recommend consulting a healthcare provider who can provide guidance based on your situation.",
