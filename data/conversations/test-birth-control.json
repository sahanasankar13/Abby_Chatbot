      "content": "Birth control refers to methods and devices used to prevent pregnancy. There are various types of birth control, each with different mechanisms of action, effectiveness, and health benefits. Here are some common forms: 1. **Birth Control Pills**: These are hormonal medications taken daily. There are two main types: - **Combination Pills**: Contain both estrogen and progestin. They are the most common type. - **Progestin-Only Pills**: Also known as mini pills, these contain only progestin. They are suitable for individuals who cannot take estrogen (Planned Parenthood, SOURCE [1]). 2. **Birth Control Shot**: Known as Depo-Provera, this is an injection given every three months. It is a convenient and effective method if administered on time (Planned Parenthood, SOURCE [2]). 3. **Birth Control Ring**: Also called the vaginal ring, this small, flexible ring is placed inside the vagina and releases hormones to prevent pregnancy. It is effective when used correctly (Planned Parenthood, SOURCE [3]). 4. **Birth Control Patch**: This is a transdermal patch worn on the skin that releases hormones to prevent pregnancy. Like other methods, it is effective when used correctly (Planned Parenthood, SOURCE [4]). Each of these methods works primarily by preventing ovulation, thickening cervical mucus to block sperm, or altering the uterine lining to prevent implantation (Planned Parenthood, SOURCE [5]). It's important to choose a birth control method that fits your lifestyle and health needs. Consulting with a healthcare provider can help you make an informed decision.",
