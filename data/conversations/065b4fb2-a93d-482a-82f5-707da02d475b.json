      "content": "In Indiana, the abortion policy is as follows: 1. **Gestational Limits**: Abortion is generally banned at all stages of pregnancy. However, there are exceptions for cases involving the life of the mother, rape or incest, lethal fetal anomalies, and major bodily function health issues. 2. **Waiting Period and Counseling**: There is an 18-hour waiting period after counseling before an abortion can be performed. Two counseling visits are required. 3. **Insurance Coverage**: - Private insurance and health exchange plans cover abortions in cases of life endangerment, major bodily function health issues, and rape or incest. - Medicaid covers abortions in cases of life endangerment, physical health issues, and rape or incest. 4. **Minors**: If you are under 18, one parent's consent is required, but there is an option for a judicial bypass if obtaining parental consent is not possible. Please note that these policies are subject to change, and it is important to consult a healthcare provider or legal expert for the most current information.",
