Is it normal to feel both relief and sadness after an abortion?,"Feeling relieved not to be pregnant and yet sad at the same time can be a confusing combination, but is common and understandable. Some women will know 'in their head' that having an abortion was the right decision and do not regret it, but at the same time feel sad 'in their heart' about the end of the pregnancy. However through time and talking with others this can resolve.",https://www.sexualhealthsheffield.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wellbeing-after-an-abortion.pdf
Why might emotions take me by surprise weeks later after an abortion?,"Some women find that a few weeks after the abortion that they feel confused or sad, but don't know why, even though they know they made the right choice for them at the time. One of the reasons for this can be that after making the decision to have an abortion, you can become focused on the process - getting through the appointments and the procedure and then trying to get 'back to normal'. The emotions involved may be tucked away during this time and then sink in and catch up with you later.",https://www.sexualhealthsheffield.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wellbeing-after-an-abortion.pdf
Is it common to feel guilty after an abortion?,"Some women feel guilty after having an abortion. This may even be so if you have held longstanding pro-choice beliefs.

It is important to allow yourself to feel, however you feel.",https://www.sexualhealthsheffield.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wellbeing-after-an-abortion.pdf
What if I feel regret after an abortion?,"Some women feel that they made the wrong decision and that it might have been the right one to continue with the pregnancy, but did not realise until afterwards.

Why might abortion feel like such an important life decision?,"It dawns on some women that they have made an important life decision - whether to have a baby and become a mother now, or not. At the time they may not have realised it, but for some women, realising that they were at such a crossroads can be enormous. On the face of it they are back to where they were before, but to get there have been through hospital appointments and a medical procedure. They were pregnant, and now they aren't. It can take longer to adjust if a woman feels that the abortion was not entirely her decision, perhaps because of pressure or strong influence from a partner or family.",https://www.sexualhealthsheffield.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wellbeing-after-an-abortion.pdf

How can writing help?,"Another way of helping to address your feelings is to write them down. If it feels daunting you can limit the time setting a timer for 10 minutes or however long you choose. Is it not school work, it's just for you so don't worry about the 'quality' of it. It is just important for you to express yourself so write down everything that comes into your head during this time. Afterwards you may want to keep it or dispose of it straight away, even burning it or ripping it up which can feel a good release. You may want to do this several times and even return to ones you have written and already kept. You may notice changes in how you have felt and what you are thinking over time.",https://www.sexualhealthsheffield.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wellbeing-after-an-abortion.pdf
How can I mark the end of the pregnancy?,"It can help to acknowledge that there was 'something there'.

They may not look at it but having it can be comforting. Other markers have been tiny teddies, plants, a tattoo or it can be anything that is personally meaningful for you. Pregnancy tissue is sensitively cremated at a local crematorium and scattered there. It can be a comfort to know that the tissue has been carefully looked after and has a final resting place.",https://www.sexualhealthsheffield.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wellbeing-after-an-abortion.pdf
How can I deal with doubts about my decision to have an abortion?,"It can be helpful to write down all your reasons for the abortion, so you can remind yourself of them if you have doubts later and start questioning yourself. Hindsight gives a different perspective and emotions, but if you find you are dwelling on 'what if', try to take yourself back to the time you made the decision. Really try to bring it to mind and know that at that point you made the best decision you could. It can be hard, but you need to let go of 'what if' and invest your energy on what you have, and pursue what is most important to you in your life at this time.",https://www.sexualhealthsheffield.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wellbeing-after-an-abortion.pdf

Can you suggest a relaxation exercise?,"Give yourself 5 minutes during your day and find somewhere comfortable, warm and quiet to sit or lie down. Close your eyes if you wish and begin by taking some slow deep breaths, and notice the breath passing through your nose. Now allow the chair or bed to take the weight of your body. Feel how each part of your body is weighing down on the chair or bed, and your feet on the floor. Notice the sound of your breathing, and see if you can stay focused on this for now.

This wise person could be someone you know in real life, or perhaps someone from TV, films or books. It could even an animal or object that you see as being very wise (an example of this might be a wise owl or an old tree). Pick someone or something that you see as compassionate (which includes having wisdom, strength and warmth, and being non-judgemental). What would this wise other say to you right now? What would they want for you? How does this make you think and feel about your decision?",https://www.sexualhealthsheffield.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wellbeing-after-an-abortion.pdf

What we hope is that in the future you will look back on this time and say 'that was difficult but it was the best decision I could make at that time'.",https://www.sexualhealthsheffield.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Wellbeing-after-an-abortion.pdf
