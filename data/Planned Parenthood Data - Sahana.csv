What kinds of emergency contraception are there?,"What kinds of emergency contraception are there?
There are 2 ways to prevent pregnancy after you have unprotected sex:
Option 1: 
You can get certain IUDs within 120 hours (five days) after having unprotected sex.
This is the most effective type of emergency contraception. These IUDs work as well on day 1 as on day 5.

Option 2:
Take an emergency contraception pill (AKA the morning-after pill) within 120 hours (5 days) after having unprotected sex.
The morning-after pill only works if you take it before you ovulate — so take it as soon as possible to be on the safe side.

There are 2 types of morning-after pills:

A pill with ulipristal acetate. There’s only one brand, called ella.

ella is the most effective type of morning-after pill.

You need a prescription from a nurse or doctor to get ella emergency contraception, but you can get a fast medical consultation and prescription with next-day delivery online from Nurx, PRJKT RUBY, or the Planned Parenthood Direct app.

You can take ella up to 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected sex — but it’s best to take it as soon as you can.

If you weigh 195 pounds or more, ella won't work as well.

A pill with levonorgestrel. Brand names include: Plan B One Step, Take Action, My Way, Option 2, Preventeza, AfterPill, My Choice, Aftera, EContra, and others.

You can buy levonorgestrel morning-after pills over the counter without a prescription in most drugstores, pharmacies, and superstores.

These types of morning-after pills work best when you take them within 72 hours (3 days) after unprotected sex, but you can take them up to 5 days after. The sooner you take them, the better they work.

If you weigh more than 165 pounds, levonorgestrel morning-after pills may not work.

You can use emergency contraception to prevent pregnancy if:
you didn’t use a condom or other birth control method when you had vaginal sex

you made a mistake with your regular birth control (forgot to take your birth control pills, change your patch or ring, or get your shot on time) and had vaginal sex

your condom broke or slipped off after ejaculation (cumming)

your partner didn't pull out in time

you were forced to have unprotected vaginal sex

Using emergency contraception correctly after you have unprotected sex makes it much less likely that you’ll get pregnant. In other words, using emergency contraception ASAP gives you a better chance of delaying ovulation before it starts.

Emergency contraception pills are safe, don’t cause any long-term side effects, and won’t affect your ability to get pregnant in the future. But using them as your only regular birth control isn’t a great idea because they’re not as effective — or as affordable — as regular, non-emergency birth control methods (like the implant, pill, or condoms).

If you have sex (or think you might have it in the future),  explore different methods of birth control to find the best method for you.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/morning-after-pill-emergency-contraception/which-kind-emergency-contraception-should-i-use
What kind of emergency contraception is best for me?,"The best emergency contraception (EC) for you depends on a few things:

How long it’s been since you had unprotected sex — you have up to 5 days after unprotected sex to use emergency contraception.

Plan B works better the sooner you take it. Plan B doesn’t work nearly as well after 3 days (72 hours).

It’s better to take ella as soon as you can. But ella is more effective than Plan B, no matter when you take it.

The Paragard, Mirena, and Liletta IUDs are the best at preventing pregnancy, and they work as well on day 5 as they do on day 1.

How much you weigh

Plan B may not work if you weigh more than 165 pounds.

ella works less well if you weigh 195 pounds or more.

IUDs work just as well no matter how much you weigh.

Which kind of EC is easiest for you to get

Plan B is usually the easiest — anyone can buy it over-the-counter without a prescription at most drugstores, pharmacies, and superstores, no matter your age or gender.

ella can be harder to get than Plan B because you need a prescription. You can call your doctor or nurse for a prescription, go to your nearest Planned Parenthood health center, or buy it online from Nurx or PRJKT RUBY. Depending on where you live you may also be able to order ella online through the Planned Parenthood Direct app.If you can’t get the most effective types of emergency contraception, remember that using whichever method you can get is still better than not using anything at all. And timing is really important — you only have up to 5 days after unprotected sex to use emergency contraception, and sooner is better. In fact, many people get the morning-after pill ahead of time and keep it at home, so they can take it as soon as possible if they need it.

Don’t use 2 different kinds of morning-after pills (like Plan B and ella) at the same time or within 5 days of each other, because they may counteract each other and not work at all.

An IUD can be hard to get within 5 days because you need an appointment for a nurse or doctor to put it in.

Whether you’re breastfeeding

Plan B and IUDs won’t affect your breast milk.

If you use ella, you’ll need to pump and throw away your breast milk for 24 hours after taking it.

How long do I have to get emergency contraception?,"You can use emergency contraception up to 5 days (120 hours) after unprotected sex. So it’s important to act quickly so you have the best options possible. It can take time to get emergency contraception, so the sooner you start looking for it, the better.

IUDs and ella are just as effective throughout the 5 days. Plan B, My Way, Take Action, and other levonorgestrel morning-after pills work less well after three days (72 hours).",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/morning-after-pill-emergency-contraception/which-kind-emergency-contraception-should-i-use
Is the morning-after pill safe?,"Morning-after pills are safe — millions of people have used different kinds of emergency contraception for more than 30 years. There have been no reports of serious complications. Morning-after pills don’t cause any long-term side effects, and they won’t change your ability to get pregnant in the future.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/morning-after-pill-emergency-contraception/which-kind-emergency-contraception-should-i-use
How many times can I use the morning-after pill?,"Taking the morning-after pill multiple times is safe and won’t hurt you. But it’s not a good idea to use the morning-after pill as your regular, go-to method of birth control. This is because:

The morning-after pill doesn’t prevent pregnancy as well as other types of birth control like the IUD, implant, pill, shot, or ring.

Taking the morning-after pill over and over again is usually more expensive and less convenient than being on a regular method of birth control.

Morning-after pill side effects — like bleeding between periods or nausea — are temporary and harmless, but they can be annoying.

So it’s totally safe to take the morning-after pill as many times as you need to — it’s just not the best way to prevent unintended pregnancies long-term. Birth control that you use before or during sex (like the IUD, implant, pill, condoms, etc.) is way more effective, affordable and convenient.

Don’t use two different kinds of morning-after pills (like Plan B and ella) at the same time or within five days of each other, because they may counteract each other and not work at all. 

One of the most convenient things about getting an IUD as emergency contraception is that it keeps giving you super effective birth control for up to 8 to 12 years (depending on which one you get). So once you get an IUD, you won’t have to worry about pregnancy again (until you stop using the IUD).",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/morning-after-pill-emergency-contraception/which-kind-emergency-contraception-should-i-use
How does emergency contraception work?,"Pregnancy doesn't happen right after you have sex — that's why it's possible to prevent pregnancy a few days after you do it. It’s all about timing.

Sperm can live inside your body for up to 6 days after sex, waiting for an egg to show up. If you ovulate during that time, the sperm can meet up with your egg and cause pregnancy. Morning-after pills work by temporarily stopping your ovary from releasing an egg. It’s kind of like pulling the emergency brake on ovulation. Where you’re at in your menstrual cycle and how soon after unprotected sex you take the morning-after pill can affect how well it prevents pregnancy. Morning-after pills won’t work if your body has already started ovulating.

This is why timing is so important, especially if you’re using Plan B and other levonorgestrel morning-after pills. (ella works closer to the time of ovulation than levonorgestrel morning-after pills like Plan B.) Most people don’t know exactly when they ovulate, so it’s best to use emergency contraception as soon as possible — no matter where you are in your menstrual cycle or whether or not you think you’re about to ovulate.

The morning-after pill is NOT the same thing as the abortion pill (also called medication abortion). The morning-after pill doesn’t cause an abortion. It won’t work if you’re already pregnant, and it won’t harm an existing pregnancy. Emergency contraception (including the IUD) is birth control, not abortion. It doesn’t end a pregnancy — it prevents one.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/morning-after-pill-emergency-contraception/which-kind-emergency-contraception-should-i-use
How much does the morning-after pill or an IUD cost?,"Plan B One-Step usually costs about $40–$50. Other brands of levonorgestrel morning-after pills like Take Action, My Way, Option 2, Preventeza, AfterPill, My Choice, Aftera, and EContra generally cost less — about $11–$45. You can sometimes get these pills for cheaper online, but they may not come in time if you need a morning-after pill right now. So you can buy it online ahead of time and put it in your medicine cabinet in case you need it in the future. Though there are many different brands of levonorgestrel morning-after pills, they all work the same way no matter how much they cost. 

If you have health insurance or Medicaid, there’s a good chance you can get morning-after pills for free — you just have to ask your nurse or doctor for a prescription so your health insurance will cover them (even though you don’t need a prescription to buy these types of morning-after pills over-the-counter). Read more about using health insurance to pay for emergency contraception.

ella usually costs about $50 or more at the pharmacy or drugstore — but it’s usually free if you have health insurance or Medicaid. ella costs $90 when you order it online (this price includes the medical consultation and overnight shipping). ella is the only brand of this type of morning-after pill. ella is more effective than Plan B and other levonorgestrel pills, especially if you weigh more than 165 pounds.

Getting an IUD costs anywhere between $0-$1,300. That’s a pretty wide range, but the good news is that IUDs are free or low cost with many health insurance plans, Medicaid, and some other government programs. And even if an IUD costs a lot up front, they usually end up saving you money in the long run because they give you really effective birth control for up to 12 years.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/morning-after-pill-emergency-contraception/which-kind-emergency-contraception-should-i-use
How long after emergency contraception should I get my period?,"It depends. Your first period after taking emergency contraception can be earlier or later that you expect it.

If you don’t get your period within 3 weeks of taking an emergency contraception pill like Plan B or ella, take a pregnancy test.

If you’re not pregnant, your menstrual cycle should return to normal the next month. Using emergency contraception often, however, can cause your periods to become irregular or unpredictable.

Emergency contraception can lower your chances of getting pregnant if you take it within 5 days (120 hours) after unprotected vaginal sex.

How can I make a homemade morning after pill?,"Home remedies don’t work. You don’t have to make your own morning-after pill (AKA emergency contraception) at home. You can buy emergency contraception pills over the counter without a prescription at drugstores and pharmacies. It doesn’t matter how old you are and it doesn’t matter what your gender is. Sometimes they’re locked up or kept behind the counter, so you may have to ask the pharmacist or store clerk for help getting it — but you don’t have to have a prescription or show your ID.

"When do I take ella?
","You can take ella up to 5 days after unprotected sex.  But if you need emergency contraception, try to get ella as quickly as you can — the sooner you act, the better.

Why take ella ASAP? Because ella works by delaying ovulation until the sperm die out (they can live in your body waiting for an egg for several days). If you take ella after you've already ovulated, it's too late and ella won't work. It's really hard to know when you ovulate, so the sooner you take ella the more likely it is to beat ovulation.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/morning-after-pill-emergency-contraception/whats-ella-morning-after-pill

If you take ella and you end up needing emergency contraception again within 5 days:

Make sure you use ella again, and not Plan B or other levonorgestrel morning-after pills.
If you took ella and want to start using a new hormonal birth control method afterward:

"Can emergency contraception delay period?
","Emergency contraception can delay your period. In fact, getting your period later or earlier than usual is one of the most common side effects of emergency contraception pills like Plan B and ella.

It’s also pretty common to have some spotting in between taking emergency contraception and getting your period, or for your period to be lighter, heavier, or a little different than usual when you do get it.

However, if you don’t get your period within 3 weeks of taking emergency contraception, take a pregnancy test.

If you aren’t pregnant, your menstrual cycle should return to normal the next month. But using emergency contraception often can cause your periods to become irregular or unpredictable. That’s 1 reason why it’s better to use a regular birth control method instead of relying on emergency contraception.

How Pregnancy Happens,"In order for pregnancy to happen, sperm needs to meet up with an egg. Pregnancy officially starts when a fertilized egg implants in the lining of the uterus. It takes up to 2-3 weeks after sex for pregnancy to happen.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/pregnancy/how-pregnancy-happens
How do people get pregnant?,"Pregnancy is actually a pretty complicated process that has several steps. It all starts with sperm cells and an egg.

Sperm are microscopic cells that are made in testicles. Sperm mixes with other fluids to make semen (cum), which comes out of the penis during ejaculation. Millions and millions of sperm come out every time you ejaculate — but it only takes 1 sperm cell to meet with an egg for pregnancy to happen.

Eggs live in ovaries, and the hormones that control your menstrual cycle cause a few eggs to mature every month. When your egg is mature, it means it’s ready to be fertilized by a sperm cell. These hormones also make the lining of your uterus thick and spongy, which gets your body ready for pregnancy.


About halfway through your menstrual cycle, one mature egg leaves the ovary — called ovulation — and travels through the fallopian tube towards your uterus.

The egg hangs out for about 12-24 hours, slowly moving through the fallopian tube, to see if any sperm are around.


If semen gets in your vagina, sperm cells can swim up through the cervix. The sperm and uterus work together to move the sperm towards the fallopian tubes. If an egg is moving through your fallopian tubes at the same time, the sperm and egg can join together. The sperm has up to six days to join with an egg before it dies.

When a sperm cell joins with an egg, it’s called fertilization. Fertilization doesn’t happen right away. Since sperm can hang out in your uterus and fallopian tube for up to 6 days after sex, there’s up to 6 days between sex and fertilization.

If a sperm cell does join up with your egg, the fertilized egg moves down the fallopian tube toward the uterus. It begins to divide into more and more cells, forming a ball as it grows. The ball of cells (called a blastocyst) gets to the uterus about 3–4 days after fertilization.


The ball of cells floats in the uterus for another 2–3 days. If the ball of cells attaches to the lining of your uterus, it’s called implantation — when pregnancy officially begins. 

Implantation usually starts about 6 days after fertilization, and takes about 3-4 days to complete. The embryo develops from cells on the inside of the ball. The placenta develops from the cells on the outside of the ball.

When a fertilized egg implants in the uterus, it releases pregnancy hormones that prevent the lining of your uterus from shedding — that’s why people don’t get periods when they’re pregnant. If your egg doesn’t meet up with sperm, or a fertilized egg doesn’t implant in your uterus, the thick lining of your uterus isn’t needed and it leaves your body during your period. Up to half of all fertilized eggs naturally don’t implant in the uterus — they pass out of your body during your period.

What are early pregnancy symptoms?,"Many people notice symptoms early in their pregnancy, but others may not have any symptoms at all.

Common signs and symptoms of pregnancy can include:

Missed period

Swollen or tender breasts

Nausea and/or vomiting

Feeling tired

Bloating

Constipation

Peeing more often than usual

Some early pregnancy symptoms can sometimes feel like other common conditions (like PMS). So the only way to know for sure if you’re pregnant is to take a pregnancy test. You can either take a home pregnancy test (the kind you buy at the drug or grocery store), or get a pregnancy test at your doctor’s office or local Planned Parenthood Health Center.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/pregnancy/how-pregnancy-happens
How do people get pregnant with twins?,"There are 2 ways that twins can happen. Identical twins are made when 1 already-fertilized egg splits into 2 separate embryos. Because identical twins come from the same sperm and egg, they have the same genetic material (DNA) and look exactly alike.

Non-identical twins (also called “fraternal” twins), are made when two separate eggs are fertilized by two separate sperm, and both fertilized eggs implant in the uterus. This can happen if your ovaries release more than one egg, or during certain kinds of fertility treatments. Non-identical twins have completely different genetic material (DNA), and usually don’t look alike. They’re the most common type of twin.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/pregnancy/how-pregnancy-happens
What is gestational duration (AKA gestational age)?,"The term “gestational duration” (also called ""gestational age"") basically means how far along into a pregnancy you are. Gestational duration is counted from the first day of your last menstrual period (called LMP).

Gestational age can be kind of confusing, since it measures pregnancy from your last period — about 3-4 weeks BEFORE you’re actually pregnant. Common knowledge about pregnancy says it lasts 9 months, and it’s true that you’re usually pregnant for about 9 months. But the way pregnancy is measured makes it a little longer. A typical full-term pregnancy ranges from 38-42 weeks LMP — around 10 months.

Many people can’t remember the exact date of their last menstrual period — that’s totally okay. Your nurse or doctor can find out the gestational duration using an ultrasound.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/pregnancy/how-pregnancy-happens
Can you get pregnant from precum?,"Your chances of getting pregnant from precum are pretty low. But it is possible.

Precum (also known as pre-ejaculate) is a small amount of fluid that comes out of the penis when you’re aroused, but before ejaculation happens. It doesn’t usually have any sperm in it. But some people’s precum does have a small amount of sperm in it sometimes. This means sperm can get into the vagina and possibly fertilize an egg.

There’s no way to know who has sperm in their precum and who doesn’t, so that’s one reason why the withdrawal method (pulling out) isn’t the best at preventing pregnancy.

If you don’t want to get pregnant, put on a condom before your genitals touch your partner’s. Even better, use both condoms and another kind of birth control together.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/pregnancy/how-pregnancy-happens
What are the stages of pregnancy?,"Pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks. The stages of pregnancy are divided into 3 trimesters. Each trimester is a little longer than 13 weeks.

You’ll go through many changes during each trimester. Some people feel lots of discomfort. Others don’t feel much at all.

During the first trimester, you’ll probably have lots of body changes, including:

Tiredness

Tender, swollen breasts

Morning sickness

Cravings or distaste for certain foods

Mood swings

Constipation

Needing to pee more often

Headache

Heartburn

Weight gain or loss

Most of these symptoms go away when you get to the second trimester. This is when your belly gets bigger and you’ll feel the fetus move. You may also notice:

Body aches

Stretch marks

Darkening of your areolas

A line on your skin running from your belly button to pubic bone

Patches of darker skin

Numb or tingling hands

Itching on your abdomen, palms, and feet

Swelling of your ankles, fingers, or face

In the third trimester, some of the same symptoms may continue. You may also experience:

Shortness of breath

Needing to pee even more often

Hemorrhoids

Your breasts leaking a watery pre-milk called colostrum

Your belly button sticking out

Trouble sleeping

The baby ""dropping"" or moving lower in your abdomen

Contractions

What are the different ways I can get pregnant?,"In order to get pregnant, sperm needs to fertilize an egg. Pregnancy officially starts when a fertilized egg (embryo) attaches to the wall of your uterus, where it grows into a baby over 9 months. There are a few different ways this can happen.

The most common way people get pregnant is from vaginal sex — when a person who has a penis ejaculates inside the other person’s vagina. Sperm cells in semen (cum) swim up the vagina, through the cervix and uterus, and into the fallopian tubes. If there’s an egg in the fallopian tube and it meets up with sperm, the fertilized egg moves down into the uterus. If the fertilized egg attaches to the wall of the uterus, pregnancy begins.

It’s also possible to get pregnant from other kinds of sexual activity — even if the penis doesn’t ejaculate inside the vagina — but this is way less common. If semen (cum) gets ON the vulva or near the vaginal opening, sperm cells can swim into the vagina and cause pregnancy. This can happen if semen drips or is wiped onto the vulva, or if someone touches your vulva or vagina with fingers or sex toys that have wet semen on them. Pre-ejaculate (pre-cum) can also have a tiny bit of sperm in it, so pre-cum may cause pregnancy if it gets into the vagina.

You can also get pregnant using different kinds of alternative insemination or in-vitro fertilization. During alternative insemination, semen is inserted into your vagina or uterus using a syringe or other device. You either put the semen in at home by yourself or with a partner, or with the help of a doctor. People can use frozen sperm from a sperm bank, or fresh sperm from a known donor (like a partner or family friend). Alternative insemination is an option for single people, couples who don’t make sperm, or couples dealing with infertility.

In-vitro fertilization is when a doctor takes eggs out of your or someone else’s body and mixes them with sperm in a lab to fertilize the eggs. Then the doctor puts the fertilized eggs (embryos) into your uterus. If one or more of the embryos attaches to your uterine lining, pregnancy begins. In-vitro fertilization helps people struggling with infertility get pregnant.

How long does it take to get pregnant?,"The amount of time it takes to get pregnant is different for each person, and can depend on a lot of things (like your age, genetics, and overall health).

If you’re fertile and having unprotected vaginal sex, there’s a very good chance you’ll get pregnant within 1 year. About 85 out of 100 people who try to get pregnant succeed within 1 year. But everyone’s different — for some people it’s much faster, while it may take longer for others.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/pregnancy/how-pregnancy-happens/what-are-some-tips-getting-pregnant
How do I increase my chances of getting pregnant?,"One of the best ways to increase your chances of getting pregnant is knowing what days you ovulate (when you’re most likely to get pregnant), and planning vaginal sex or insemination around those days.

Everyone’s body is different, but ovulation usually happens about 14 days before your period starts. An egg lives for about 1 day after it’s released (ovulation), and sperm can live in the body for about 6 days after sex. So people are usually fertile for around 7 days of every menstrual cycle: the 5 days before you ovulate, and the day you ovulate. You can also get pregnant a day or 2 after ovulation, but it's less likely.

Some people have very regular cycles, and some people’s cycles vary from month to month. Many people track their menstrual cycles and other fertility signs to help them figure out when they’re ovulating. This is called fertility awareness — some people use it to prevent pregnancy, and others use it to try to get pregnant.

You can use a fertility chart to keep track of your cycle and when you’re most fertile (like your body temperature, changes in your cervical mucus, and your menstrual cycle). There are apps that can make it easy to chart your cycle and figure out your fertile days.

You can also use ovulation predictor kits — urine tests that tell you when you’re ovulating. You can buy ovulation predictor tests in the drugstore, usually near the pregnancy tests. Ovulation predictor tests look for a hormone called luteinizing hormone, which increases in your body right before you ovulate.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/pregnancy/how-pregnancy-happens/what-are-some-tips-getting-pregnant
How do I get pregnant if I was on birth control?,"If you’re on birth control and want to get pregnant, simply stop using your birth control method. With most methods (like the IUD, implant, pill, patch, and ring), fertility usually comes back right after you stop using it — often within the same month.

Birth control doesn’t hurt your ability to get pregnant long-term, but a few types (like the Depo shot) may temporarily affect your fertility for several months after you stop using it.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/pregnancy/how-pregnancy-happens/what-are-some-tips-getting-pregnant

What is sexual orientation?,"Sexual orientation is about who you’re attracted to and want to have relationships with. Sexual orientations include gay, lesbian, straight, bisexual, and asexual.

Sexual orientation is different from gender and gender identity.
Sexual orientation is about who you’re attracted to and who you feel drawn to romantically, emotionally, and sexually. It’s different than gender identity. Gender identity isn’t about who you’re attracted to, but about who you ARE — male, female, genderqueer, etc.

This means that being transgender (feeling like your assigned sex is very different from the gender you identify with) isn’t the same thing as being gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Sexual orientation is about who you want to be with. Gender identity is about who you are.

There are a bunch of identities associated with sexual orientation:

People who’re attracted to a different gender (for example, women who are attracted to men or men who are attracted to women) often call themselves straight or heterosexual.

People who’re attracted to people of the same gender often call themselves gay or homosexual. Gay women may prefer the term lesbian.

People who’re attracted to both men and women often call themselves bisexual.

People whose attractions span across many different gender identities (male, female, transgender, genderqueer, intersex, etc.) may call themselves pansexual or queer.

People who’re unsure about their sexual orientation may call themselves questioning or curious.

People who don't experience any sexual attraction for anyone often call themselves asexual.

It’s also important to note that some people don't think any of these labels describe them accurately. Some people don't like the idea of labels at all. Other people feel comfortable with certain labels and not others. It's up to you to decide how you want to label yourself, if at all.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/sexual-orientation/sexual-orientation
What does queer mean?,"The term queer can include a variety of sexual identities and gender identities that are anything other than straight and cisgender.

In the past, “queer” was a word used to hurt and insult people. Some people still find it offensive, particularly those who remember when that word was used in a painful way. Others now use the word with pride to identify themselves.

You may not want to refer to someone as “queer” unless you know that’s how they identify themselves. When talking to someone about their sexual orientation, use the terms that they use. It’s okay (and often encouraged!) to ask what labels folks prefer.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/sexual-orientation/sexual-orientation
What’s asexuality?,"People who identify as asexual don’t really feel sexual attraction towards anyone. They may think other people are physically attractive, or they may want to be in romantic relationships with people — but they’re not interested in having sex or doing sexual things with other people. Asexual people sometimes use the word “ace” for short.  

Asexuality has nothing to do with romantic attraction. Many asexual people feel romantically attracted to people — so they may identify as asexual, and also as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or straight. They just don’t feel any desire to act on these feelings in a sexual way.

Asexual people have emotional needs just like everyone else. Some asexual people have romantic relationships, and others aren’t interested in that. They get close to people or experience intimacy through ways other than sex.

There are also people who don’t feel romantic attraction or want to be in romantic relationships — they may identify as aromantic. Being aromantic and being asexual are two separate things.

Some asexual people do get aroused (turned on), but they don’t feel the desire to be sexual with other people. And some asexual people masturbate. But others may not feel arousal at all.

It’s totally normal to go through times when you don’t want to have sex, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re asexual. And asexuality is not the same thing as being celibate. Celibacy is a choice you make, and asexuality is a sexual identity — who you naturally are.

Like other sexual orientations, asexuality isn’t always black and white. There’s a spectrum between being sexual (having sexual attraction) and being asexual. Different people fall into different places on that spectrum. Some people who have very little sexual attraction to other people identify as gray-a. Some people who are only sexually attracted to people they’re in relationships with identify as demisexual. Want to know how someone identifies? Ask them.

There is nothing “wrong” with people who are asexual, and there’s no evidence to support that people are asexual because of any kind of mental health or trauma. It’s actually kind of common — some research says that 1 out of 100 adults is asexual. You can find more information about asexuality at the Asexual Visibility and Education Network.

What if I don’t want to be labeled?,"It’s okay if you don’t want to be labeled. Only you can decide what sexual identity best describes you. But some people may feel that none of the common labels feel right to them.

Your sexual orientation and identity can stay the same, or it can change based on how you feel throughout your life. You don’t have to decide on one label, or any label at all. And there’s no reason why the labels you use can’t change as you change.

Changing how you identify doesn’t mean that you’re “confused.” Many folks, old and young, experience changes in who they’re attracted to and how they identify. This is called “fluidity.”",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/sexual-orientation/sexual-orientation
What causes sexual orientation?,"It’s not completely known why someone might be lesbian, gay, straight, or bisexual. But research shows that sexual orientation is likely caused partly by biological factors that start before birth.

People don’t decide who they’re attracted to, and therapy, treatment, or persuasion won’t change a person’s sexual orientation. You also can’t “turn” a person gay. For example, exposing a boy to toys traditionally made for girls, such as dolls, won’t cause him to be gay.

You probably started to become aware of who you’re attracted to at a very young age. This doesn’t mean that you had sexual feelings, just that you could identify people you found attractive or liked. Many people say that they knew they were lesbian, gay, or bisexual even before puberty.

Although sexual orientation is usually set early in life, it isn’t at all uncommon for your desires and attractions to shift throughout your life. This is called “fluidity.” Many people, including sex researchers and scientists, believe that sexual orientation is like a scale with entirely gay on one end and entirely straight on the other. Lots of people would be not on the far ends, but somewhere in the middle.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/sexual-orientation/sexual-orientation/what-causes-sexual-orientation
How many people are LGBTQ+?,"LGBTQ+ stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer/Questioning.

Although researchers try to study how many people are LGBTQ+, it’s very difficult to get an accurate number. This is because gender identity, sexual orientation, sexual identity, and sexual behavior are complicated for people. Let’s break it down:

Gender identity is who you feel you are inside and how you express those feelings through how you act, talk, dress, etc.

Sexual attraction is the romantic or sexual feelings you have toward others.

Sexual identity is how you label yourself (for example, using labels such as queer, gay, lesbian, straight, or bisexual).

Sexual behavior is who you have sex with and what kinds of sex you like to have.

Sometimes all of these things are in line for a person. For example, a woman may feel attracted only to women, identify as a lesbian, and have sexual relationships with only women.

But these things don’t always line up. Not everyone who has sexual feelings or attractions to the same gender will act on them. Some people may engage in same gender sexual behavior but not identify themselves as bisexual, lesbian, or gay. In some situations, coming out as LGBTQ+ can provoke fear and discrimination, and not everyone is comfortable coming out. For some people, sexual orientation can shift at different periods in their lives and the labels they use for themselves may shift, too.

So it’s difficult to measure how many people are LGBTQ+ when sexual orientation and gender are so complex for so many people. And not everyone feels safe or comfortable telling someone else that they’re LGBTQ+.

Recent research suggests that 11% of American adults acknowledge at least some same-sex attraction, 8.2% report that they’ve engaged in same-sex behavior, but only 3.5% identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. This shows that what people feel or do is not always the same as how they identify themselves.

What if I’m unsure about my sexual orientation?,"This is really common, and it doesn’t mean that anything is wrong with you. For some people, understanding their sexual orientation can take years, or even a lifetime. Often, people find that they're “questioning"" for a while, or that none of the labels used to describe sexual orientation fit them.

Some people may try a label to see if it fits, and then change it to another one if it doesn’t. This is okay, too. You don’t have to decide on one label, and it’s okay if someday in the future you feel differently from how you feel now.

Some people struggle with coming out to others or even themselves because they’re afraid of homophobia and sexual orientation discrimination. These are very real issues that many LGBTQ+ people face.

Can other people tell what my sexual orientation is?,"No. A person only knows your sexual orientation if you tell them. Sexual orientation describes how you feel inside, and only you know what it’s like to be you.  

Some people may think they can guess if a person is lesbian, gay, or bisexual based on superficial factors like how they look, dress, or behave. These are stereotypes, or very simplified judgments, about how lesbian, gay, and bisexual people act. But just like heterosexuals, there are many different ways that homosexual and bisexual people look, dress, and behave.

"What's ""coming out""?","Coming out refers to the process that people who are LGBTQ+ go through as they work to accept their sexual orientation or gender identity and share that identity openly with other people.

Coming out is a very brave thing to do, and it’s extremely personal and different for everyone. Your emotions when coming out may range from scared and anxious to elated and relieved.

There’s no one right way to come out. It can feel better to be open and honest about your sexual orientation than to hide it, but there are many factors to consider before coming out.

Coming out is a process. Often the first step is coming out to yourself. This happens as you recognize your sexual orientation and begin to accept it. Next, you might choose to tell your family, friends, and people in your community — sometimes right away, and sometimes later. You might decide to be open with some people in your life, but not with others.
Coming out isn’t a one-time thing. Because many people assume that everyone they meet is straight, coming out is a constant process. Every time an LGBTQ-identified person meets someone new (friends, co-workers, nurses and doctors, etc.), they have to decide if, when, and how to come out.

Choosing to come out depends on the situation. The coming-out process can be freeing and can bring you closer to the people you love. But it can also be stressful or even risky or dangerous. You may feel safer not coming out in certain situations.  You don’t have to be out everywhere, all the time. You can decide what’s best for you.

Coming out can have benefits and risks. If you’re wondering whether to come out, there's a lot to consider. Does coming out mean that you risk losing emotional or financial support from your family? Could coming out put you in physical danger? Will your family try to pressure you into being someone you’re not?  If you answered yes to any of these questions, you may want to wait until you’re in a different situation or have more support.

You, and only you, are in charge of your coming out experience. It's up to you to choose how, where, when, and with whom to be open about your sexual orientation (and gender identity). It may feel safer to start by being open with other people who also identify as LGBTQ+. This could be online, in community centers, at an LGBTQ+ club or group, or with a few close friends.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/sexual-orientation/sexual-orientation/whats-coming-out
How do I come out to my parents and friends?,"There’s no single, correct way to come out to your family and friends. You’re the expert in what feels right to you, and who it feels safest to tell.

Here are some suggestions that might make the conversation easier:

When you decide that you’re ready to come out, give yourself some time to practice how you’ll do it and what you’ll say.

Identify the people or person in your life that you think will be the most okay with the news, and come out to them first. You can often get a sense of how friendly someone is to LGBTQ+ people by how they react when the topic comes up in conversation.

Do some research so that you have information about being LGBTQ+ in case your loved one has questions or doesn’t have the facts.

You may be more comfortable coming out by writing a letter or e-mail rather than telling someone in person. That’s totally fine.  

After you decide who you’ll come out to, what you’ll say to them, and how you’ll say it, be prepared to wait as they digest and accept the new information. Give them the time they need.

Don’t assume that everyone will react with prejudice — go in with an open mind. Some people may surprise you with their openness and acceptance, and many folks already know other LGBTQ+ people in their lives.

What is homophobia?,"The homophobia definition is the fear, hatred, discomfort with, or mistrust of people who are lesbian, gay, or bisexual. Biphobia is fear, hatred, discomfort, or mistrust, specifically of people who are bisexual. Similarly, transphobia is fear, hatred, discomfort with, or mistrust of people who are transgender, genderqueer, or don’t follow traditional gender norms.

Although transphobia, biphobia, and homophobia are similar, they’re not the same thing. Both gay and straight people can be transphobic and biphobic, and people can be transphobic without being homophobic or biphobic.

Homophobia can take many different forms, including negative attitudes and beliefs about, aversion to, or prejudice against bisexual, lesbian, and gay people. It’s often based in irrational fear and misunderstanding. Some people’s homophobia may be rooted in conservative religious beliefs. People may hold homophobic beliefs if they were taught them by parents and families.

Homophobic people may use mean language and name-calling when they talk about lesbian and gay people. Biphobic people may tell bisexual people that it’s “just for attention,” or that they’re inherently cheaters. In its most extreme forms, homophobia and biphobia can cause people to bully, abuse, and inflict violence on lesbian, gay, and bisexual people.

Some LGBTQ+ people experience discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. This may be discrimination from religious institutions, companies, or from our government. Examples include same-sex couples not being allowed to marry, getting legally fired just for being LGBTQ+, or not being allowed into certain housing.

LGBTQ+ people and their allies have fought for equal rights and continue to do so, especially concerning marriage, employment, housing and health care equality, and protection from hate crimes (violence against LGBTQ+ people because of who they are).",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/sexual-orientation/sexual-orientation/what-homophobia
What is internalized homophobia?,"Internalized homophobia refers to people who are homophobic while also experiencing same-sex attraction themselves. Sometimes, people may have negative attitudes and beliefs about those who experience same-sex attraction, and then turn the negative beliefs in on themselves rather than come to terms with their own desires. This may mean that they feel discomfort and disapproval with their own same-sex attractions, never accept their same-sex attractions, or never identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual.

People dealing with internalized homophobia may feel the need to “prove” that they’re straight, exhibit very stereotypical behavior of straight men and women, or even bully and discriminate against openly gay people.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/sexual-orientation/sexual-orientation/what-homophobia
What is outing?,"Outing is the act of revealing someone else's sexual orientation without their permission. If you share information about someone's sexual orientation against their wishes, you risk affecting their lives very negatively by making them feel embarrassed, upset, and vulnerable.

You may also put them at risk for discrimination and violence. If someone shares their orientation with you, remember that this is very personal information and it’s an honor that they trusted you enough to tell you. Always ask them what you’re allowed to share with others and respect their wishes.

If you’re a young person who’s experiencing harassment in school, it’s important to tell someone, even if that seems scary. If you don’t seek help and just accept it, the harassment will probably continue, or maybe even get worse over time. This can make it hard to keep up with grades, activities, and school in general.

Some schools may have an anti-bullying and harassment policy, and some states have adopted a Safe Schools Law, which means that your school administrators are legally required to stop the harassment.

Don’t ever use negative or offensive language to describe LGBTQ+ people.

Be careful of how even casual language — such as saying “that’s so gay”— can hurt others.

Don’t believe stereotypes about LGBTQ+ people or make assumptions about them.

Be a vocal supporter of the LGBTQ+ community, regardless of your own sexual orientation and identity. This is called being an ally.

Let the LGBTQ+ people in your life know that you’re a friend and ally.

Educate yourself on LGBTQ+ issues.

Respect LGBTQ+ people’s decisions about when and where to come out.

Join your school’s Gay/Straight Alliance, or start one at your school. GLSEN can help with that.

Remember that being LGBTQ+ is just one part of a person’s complex identity and life.

Show as much interest in your LGBTQ+ friends’ or family members’ partners as you would show in a straight person’s partner.

If you feel safe doing so, speak up when other people are being homophobic or biphobic, such as making offensive jokes, using negative language, or bullying or harassing someone because of their sexual orientation or identity.

When addressing homophobia in others:

Decide if it’s safe to address the issue. Some things to consider: Will you be confronting a stranger in public? Or a friend or family member in private? Do you want to speak up now or save it for later, when you’re alone with the person? Would it be safest for you leave it alone and walk away?

Ask questions and stay calm. Often, people don’t know that the language they’re using is insensitive. Avoid insulting them and tell them why you find their words offensive.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/sexual-orientation/sexual-orientation/what-homophobia
What are the step by step guide to getting an abortion,"Step 1: Learn about the laws in your state (Varies by state)

Understand legality and restrictions: Abortion laws differ by state, including whether it's legal and how late into pregnancy it can be performed. You may need to travel to another state for care.
Check waiting periods: Some states require waiting periods of 1-3 days after your first appointment before proceeding with an abortion.
Find out parental consent requirements: If you're under 18, certain states require parental consent or notification. You can seek a judicial bypass to avoid this requirement.
Protect your digital data privacy: Refer to resources like the Digital Defense Fund for privacy protection.
Step 2: Book your appointment (Applies to everyone)

How to book: Schedule your appointment online or by phone. Many abortion funds and financial assistance programs require you to have an appointment confirmed first. Use services like plannedparenthood.org or AbortionFinder.org to book.
Step 3: Figure out logistics and cost (Varies by state)

Insurance coverage: Contact your insurance provider to determine if abortion services are covered.
Financial support options: If insurance doesn’t cover the costs, contact the health center where you have your appointment. They may help with both medical and travel expenses.
Abortion funds: Some organizations offer financial assistance for both medical and travel costs.
Step 4: Prepare for your abortion (Applies to everyone)

Get your abortion pills: Depending on your state, you may be able to have a video consultation and receive pills by mail. Alternatively, you may need to visit a health center to pick up the medication. Anti-nausea medicine may also be provided.
Collect post-abortion supplies: Gather the following items to manage symptoms after the abortion:
Maxi pads
Pain medicine (e.g., ibuprofen or acetaminophen)
Step 5: Know what to expect after your abortion (Applies to everyone)

Cramps and bleeding: Expect cramps and bleeding that can last for several hours and decrease gradually. You may notice large blood clots or tissue clumps.
Manage temporary side effects: Symptoms like chills, fever, or nausea should resolve within 24 hours.
Seek medical attention if needed: Contact your doctor or health center if you experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or fever lasting more than 24 hours after taking misoprostol. These symptoms may indicate an infection.

Is abortion the right option for me?,"Abortion is common, and people have abortions for many different reasons.  Only you know what’s best for you, but good information and support can help you make the decision that's best for your own health and well-being. ",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/considering-abortion
Why do people decide to have an abortion?,"If you’re thinking about having an abortion, you’re not alone. Millions of people face unplanned pregnancies every year, and about 4 out of 10 of them decide to get an abortion. Some people with planned pregnancies also get abortions because of health or safety reasons. Overall, about 1 in 4 women in the U.S. will have an abortion by the time they’re 45 years old.

Sometimes, the decision is simple. Other times, it’s complicated. But either way, the decision to have an abortion is personal, and you’re the only one who can make it.

Everyone has their own unique and valid reasons for having an abortion. Some of the many different reasons people decide to end a pregnancy include:

They want to be the best parent possible to the kids they already have.
They’re not ready to be a parent yet.
It’s not a good time in their life to have a baby.
They want to finish school, focus on work, or achieve other goals before having a baby.
They’re not in a relationship with someone they want to have a baby with.
They’re in an abusive relationship or were sexually assaulted.
The pregnancy is dangerous or bad for their health.
The fetus won’t survive the pregnancy or will suffer after birth.
They just don’t want to be a parent.
Deciding to have an abortion doesn’t mean you don’t want or love children. In fact, 6 out of 10 people who get abortions already have kids — and many of them decide to end their pregnancies so they can focus on the children they already have. And people who aren’t already parents when they get an abortion often go on to have a baby later, when they feel they're in a better position to be a good parent. The bottom line is, deciding if and when to have a baby is very personal, and only you know what’s best for you and your family.

What can I think about to help me decide?,"Family, relationships, school, work, life goals, health, safety, and personal beliefs — people think carefully about these things before having an abortion. But you’re the only person walking in your shoes, and the only person who can decide whether to have an abortion.   

Here are some things to consider if you are thinking about an abortion:

Am I ready to be a parent?
Would I consider adoption?
What would it mean for my future if I had a child now?
What would it mean for my family if I had a child now?
How would being a parent affect my career goals?
Do I have strong personal or religious beliefs about abortion?
Is anyone pressuring me to have or not have an abortion?
Would having a baby change my life in a way I do or don’t want?
Would having an abortion change my life in a way I do or don’t want?
What kind of support would I need and get if I decided to get an abortion?
What kind of support would I need and get if I decided to have a baby?
Decisions about your pregnancy are personal. There are lots of things to consider, and it’s totally normal to have many different feelings and thoughts when making this decision. That’s why it’s important to get factual, non-judgmental information about abortion. Support from family, friends, partners, and other people you trust can also be helpful.

Your local Planned Parenthood health center has caring professionals that can answer any questions you may have. They'll give you expert care, accurate information about all your options, and non-judgmental support along the way — no matter what you decide about your pregnancy.

Other family planning centers, private doctors, and abortion providers may also talk with you about your decision. But when you’re looking for a reliable health center, beware of anti-abortion “crisis pregnancy centers.” These are places that may seem like normal medical clinics and claim to offer information about pregnancy options and abortion, but they don't provide abortion or a full range of health care. They often give you false or misleading information about pregnancy, abortion, and birth control, and they usually don't have to follow privacy laws. Crisis pregnancy centers are often located very close to Planned Parenthood health centers or other real medical centers, and have similar names — they do this to confuse people and trick them into visiting them instead. 

No one should pressure you into making any decision about your pregnancy, no matter what. So it’s important to get the info and support you need from people who give you the real facts and won’t judge you.

What are the different kinds of abortion?,"Medication abortion — also called the “abortion pill” —  is when you take medicines to end an early pregnancy, up to 11 weeks after the first day of your last period. 

In-clinic abortion is generally a fast and simple procedure that a trained doctor or nurse does in a health center. 

Both kinds of abortion are safe and effective.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/considering-abortion/what-facts-about-abortion-do-i-need-know
How does abortion work?,"In-clinic Abortion
A doctor or nurse uses medical instruments and gentle suction to take the pregnancy out of your uterus through your vagina.

Medication Abortion
You take pills that end your pregnancy and cause cramping and bleeding so the pregnancy tissue comes out of your uterus through your vagina. It’s like an early miscarriage.

There are two ways to have a medication abortion using pills. You can use two medicines: mifepristone and misoprostol. Or you can use misoprostol alone.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/considering-abortion/what-facts-about-abortion-do-i-need-know
How well does abortion work?,"In-Clinic Abortion
It works more than 99% of the time.

Medication Abortion
Taking mifepristone and misoprostol together works about 87-99% of the time — depending on how far along the pregnancy is and how many doses of misoprostol you take.

Taking both mifepristone and misoprostol works a bit better than taking misoprostol only. 

Taking misoprostol alone works to end the pregnancy about 85-95% of the time — depending on how far along the pregnancy is and how you take the medicine.

If a medication abortion doesn’t work, you can take more medicine or have an in-clinic procedure.

",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/considering-abortion/what-facts-about-abortion-do-i-need-know
How long does the abortion take?,"In-Clinic Abortion
The procedure usually takes about 10 minutes, but the full visit usually takes a few hours. Some states have laws that say you must come to the health center for a separate visit before the abortion. Abortions later in pregnancy may take longer and you may need more visits to the health center.

Medication Abortion
Your appointment will look different depending on the state you live in and whether your appointment is in-person or virtual. In some states you’re required to come for multiple visits and it may take up to a few hours. In other states it may be a fairly quick video visit and then you pick up your pills at a pharmacy or have them mailed to you.

If you’re using mifepristone and misoprostol together, you’ll take the pills at the same time or up to 2 days apart, depending on your situation.

If you’re using misoprostol only, you’ll take 3-4 doses of pills, 3 hours apart.

Most people finish passing the pregnancy tissue 4-5 hours after taking misoprostol, but it can take longer. The abortion will usually be finished within 24 hours after you take the last dose of pills. 

You can have a follow up visit or phone call to make sure everything is going well, but you’ll also get a special pregnancy test you can take at home to make sure the abortion worked.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/considering-abortion/what-facts-about-abortion-do-i-need-know
Is abortion safe?,"Both in-clinic and medication abortions are very safe. In fact, abortion is one of the safest medical procedures out there — it has a lower complication rate than other common medical procedures, like getting your wisdom teeth pulled. And abortion pills are safer than medicines like penicillin, Tylenol, and Viagra. 

Abortion is also very common: About 1 in 4 women in the U.S. will have an abortion by the time they’re 45 years old.

You can count on Planned Parenthood for expert, quality sexual and reproductive health care, including abortion. They regularly review new medical research and get updates from groups like the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

How will I feel after having an abortion?,"You’ll get written after-care instructions and a phone number you can call if you have any questions or concerns. You may have to come back for a check up or lab work after your abortion.

Plan on resting after your abortion. You can usually go back to work, school and most other normal activities the next day. Avoid hard work or heavy exercise for a few days. You can use pads, tampons, or a menstrual cup for any bleeding —  whatever's the most comfortable for you. But your nurse or doctor may tell you to use pads so you can track how much you're bleeding. You can have sex as soon as you feel ready.

Most people feel fine within a day or two, but it’s common for bleeding to last for a week (or several weeks after the abortion pill). Cramping can happen for a few days.

It’s totally normal to have a lot of different emotions after your abortion. Everyone’s experience is different, and there’s no “right” or “wrong” way to feel. Most people are relieved and don’t regret their decision. Others may feel sadness, guilt, or regret after an abortion. Lots of people have all these feelings at different times. These feelings aren’t unique to having an abortion. People feel many different emotions after giving birth, too.

It’s rare to have serious, long-term effects on your mental health after an abortion. But everybody’s different, and certain things can make coping with an abortion hard — like if you had to have an abortion for health reasons, or you didn’t have support.

Most people feel better if they have someone supportive to talk to after an abortion. But even if you don’t think there’s anybody in your life you can talk with, you’re not alone. Your nurse or doctor can talk with you, or help you find a licensed counselor or a non-judgmental support group.

What is the abortion pill?,"“Abortion pill” is the common name for using two different medicines to end a pregnancy: mifepristone and misoprostol. You can also use misoprostol alone to have an abortion.

First, you take a pill called mifepristone. Pregnancy needs a hormone called progesterone to grow normally. Mifepristone blocks your body’s own progesterone, stopping the pregnancy from growing.

Then you take the second medicine, misoprostol, either right away or up to 48 hours later. This medicine causes cramping and bleeding to empty your uterus. It’s kind of like having a really heavy, crampy period, and the process is very similar to an early miscarriage. If you don’t have any bleeding within 24 hours after taking misoprostol, call your nurse or doctor.

Your doctor or nurse may give you both medicines at the health center. In some states you can do a virtual visit and have the pills mailed to you or pick them up at a local pharmacy. Some states have laws that say you must come to the health center for a separate visit before you get the abortion pills.

Your doctor or nurse will give you detailed directions about where, when, and how to take the medicines. And they’ll talk with you about medicines to manage side effects, like cramp pain and nausea.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/the-abortion-pill
How effective is the abortion pill?,"The abortion pill is very effective. If you’re taking mifepristone and misoprostol, it depends on how far along the pregnancy is, and how many doses of medicine you take:

At 8 weeks pregnant or less, it works about 94-98% of the time.
At 8-9 weeks pregnant, it works about 94-96% of the time.
At 9-10 weeks pregnant, it works about 91-93% of the time. 
If you take an extra dose of misoprostol, it works about 99% of the time.
At 10-11 weeks pregnant, it works about 87% of the time. 
If you take an extra dose of misoprostol, it works about 98% of the time.
In general, taking both mifepristone and misoprostol works a bit better than taking misoprostol only. 

Taking misoprostol alone works to end the pregnancy about 85-95% of the time — depending on how far along the pregnancy is and how you take the medicine.

The abortion pill usually works, but if it doesn’t, you can take more medicine or have an in-clinic abortion.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/the-abortion-pill
When can I take the abortion pill?,"In general, you can have a medication abortion up to 77 days (11 weeks) after the first day of your last period. If it’s been 78 days or more since the first day of your last period, you can have an in-clinic abortion to end your pregnancy.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/the-abortion-pill
Why do people choose the abortion pill?,"Which kind of abortion you choose all depends on your personal preference and situation. With medication abortion, some people like that you don’t need to have a procedure in a doctor’s office. You can have your medication abortion on your own schedule, at home or in another comfortable place that you choose. You get to decide who you want to be with during your abortion, or you can go it alone. Because medication abortion is similar to a miscarriage, many people feel like it’s more “natural” and less invasive. And some people may not have an in-clinic abortion provider close by, so abortion pills are more available to them.

Your doctor, nurse, or health center staff can help you decide which kind of abortion is best for you.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/the-abortion-pill
Can the abortion pill be reversed after you have taken it?,"The “abortion pill” is the popular name for a safe and effective way to end an early pregnancy using a combination of two medicines: mifepristone and misoprostol. Mifepristone stops the pregnancy from growing. After taking mifepristone, you take a second medicine (misoprostol) up to 48 hours later. This causes cramping and bleeding and empties your uterus.

Claims about treatments that reverse the effects of medication abortion are out there, and a handful of states require doctors and nurses to tell their patients about them before they can provide abortion care. But these claims haven’t been proven in reliable medical studies — and they haven’t been tested for safety, effectiveness, or the likelihood of side effects — so experts like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reject these untested treatment ideas.

Studies on the abortion pill do show that if you take the first medicine (mifepristone) but don’t take the second (misoprostol) the abortion is less likely to work. So if you took mifepristone (the first medicine) but are having second thoughts, contact the doctor or nurse you saw for the abortion right away to talk about your best next steps and what to expect.

If you started taking misoprostol, It’s important to keep in mind that misoprostol can cause birth defects if the pregnancy continues. So contact your nurse or doctor right away if you’re having second thoughts about your abortion.

RU-486 was developed in the 1980s. It's been safely used in Europe since 1987, and in the US since 2000.

RU-486 blocks a hormone that your body needs to continue a pregnancy. It works best when you use it with another medication called misoprostol, which causes bleeding to empty your uterus.

"
What happens if I take the abortion pill after 11 weeks?
","The abortion pill is very effective, but it works less well when you’re more than 8 weeks pregnant. The effectiveness depends on how far along you are in your pregnancy and when you take the medicine. After 11 weeks, there’s a bigger chance of stronger bleeding or cramps. 

You can make sure that your medication abortion worked by taking a pregnancy test, ultrasound, or blood test. Your nurse or doctor will also walk you through everything you need to know during your medication abortion appointment.

Regular pregnancy tests that you get at the store and some health centers may give you a false positive result for up to 5 weeks after your abortion — that’s because it takes a while for the pregnancy hormones to leave your body, and the test can pick those up, but it doesn’t always mean you’re pregnant.

However, it IS possible to get pregnant very soon after an abortion — even if pregnancy tests are coming up positive or your period hasn’t started yet. So if you’ve had sex without using birth control since having an abortion, a positive pregnancy test could mean that you’re pregnant again.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/the-abortion-pill
What do I need to do before I take the abortion pill?,"Before you take the abortion pill, you’ll meet with your nurse, doctor, or health center staff to talk about whether abortion is the right decision for you, and what your abortion options are.

If you go to the health center in person, you may get an exam, lab tests, and an ultrasound to figure out how far into your pregnancy you are. In some states you can do a virtual visit, and if lab tests are needed you can do that at a local lab test provider.

Your nurse or doctor will let you know if there’s anything else you need to do to prepare for your abortion. They’ll give you written instructions on how to take your pills. You will have access to a caring professional through the process — you’ll get a number you can call 24/7 if you have any questions or concerns.

You’ll have a lot of bleeding and cramping after you take misoprostol, so plan ahead to make the process more comfortable. You can be at home, or wherever is comfortable for you to rest. You may also want to have someone you trust with you (or nearby) that you can call if you need anything. The abortion process takes several hours, so try to clear your schedule for the day and just focus on caring for yourself if you can.

Stock up on maxi pads, food, books, movies, or whatever you like to help pass the time, and a heating pad for cramps. Make sure you have some pain medicine like ibuprofen — but don’t take aspirin because it can make you bleed more.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/the-abortion-pill
What happens during a medication abortion?,"The abortion pill process has several steps and usually includes 2 different medicines: mifepristone and misoprostol. You can also have an abortion using only misoprostol.

First, you take mifepristone. This pill stops the pregnancy from growing.  Most people don’t feel anything after taking the mifepristone.

The second medicine is misoprostol. You’ll either take the misoprostol right away, or up to 48 hours after you take the first pill — your doctor or nurse will let you know how and when to take it. This medicine causes cramping and bleeding that empties your uterus. The pregnancy tissue will come out through your vagina. The process is very similar to an early miscarriage.

You can take pain medicine like ibuprofen about 30 minutes before you take the misoprostol to help with cramps. Don’t take aspirin, because it can make you bleed more. You can also take anti-nausea medicine if your doctor or nurse gives it to you to help with side effects.

You can expect the cramping and bleeding to start 1-4 hours after taking the misoprostol. It’s normal to see large blood clots (up to the size of a lemon) or clumps of tissue during the abortion. But the pregnancy itself is very small — at 8 weeks, an embryo is about ¼ to ½ inch long. You may not see it when it comes out, especially if you’re less than 8 weeks pregnant.

The cramping and bleeding can last for several hours. Most people finish passing the pregnancy tissue in 4-5 hours, but it may take longer. The cramping and bleeding slows down after the pregnancy tissue comes out. You may have cramps on and off for 1 or 2 more days.

It’s normal to have some bleeding and spotting for several weeks after your abortion. You can use pads, tampons, or a menstrual cup —  whatever's the most comfortable for you. But your nurse or doctor may recommend you use pads while the abortion is happening so you can track how much you're bleeding.

The last step is to make sure the abortion worked. You may go back into the health center for an ultrasound or blood test. Or you’ll get a pregnancy test to take at home, followed by a phone call with your nurse or doctor if you want. These tests will make sure the abortion worked and that you’re healthy.

In the unlikely case that the abortion doesn't work and you're still pregnant, your doctor or nurse will discuss your options with you. You may need another dose of medicine or to have an in-clinic procedure to complete the abortion.

First, you’ll take a pill called mifepristone. Pregnancy needs a hormone called progesterone to grow normally. Mifepristone blocks your body’s own progesterone, which stops the pregnancy from growing. 

Then you’ll take the second medicine, misoprostol, either right away or up to 48 hours later.

30 minutes before you take misoprostol:

Take pain medicine to help with cramps. Ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) works the best, but you can take a different pain medicine like acetaminophen (Tylenol) if you need to. But don’t take aspirin because it can make you bleed more. 
Take medicine for nausea if you have it.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/the-abortion-pill
How do I take the second medicine?,"There are a few different ways to take misoprostol. You can put the pills in your vagina (vaginal), under your tongue (sublingual), or in your mouth between your cheeks and gums (buccal). They’ll slowly break down, and your body will absorb the medicine through the skin in your vagina or mouth. Don’t just swallow the pills — this will make them not work as well, and will probably make you feel very nauseous.

Your doctor or nurse will talk you through the best way for you to take the pills. Here are the steps for each method:

Buccal

Take 24-48 hours after you take mifepristone.

Tuck 2 pills between your cheek and your gum on the side of your mouth. Do the same thing with 2 more pills on the other side of your mouth.
Leave them there for 30 minutes.
If there are still pieces of the pills left after 30 minutes, swallow them with water. 
Sublingual

Take 24-48 hours after you take mifepristone.

Put 4 misoprostol pills under your tongue.
Leave them there for 30 minutes.
If there are still pieces of the pills left after 30 minutes, swallow them with water. 
Vaginal 

Insert 0-48 hours after you take mifepristone.

Wash your hands.
Put 4 pills deep into your vagina, as far as they’ll go. Put in 1 pill at a time.
Lay down for 30 minutes so they don’t fall out.
Pieces of the pills may fall out of your vagina later. If it’s been more than 30 minutes since you put that dose of pills in your vagina, your body should have absorbed enough of the medicine so you don’t need to put them back in.
Some people will need a second dose of misoprostol. If your nurse or doctor tells you to take a second dose, you’ll take 4 more misoprostol pills 4 hours later. Misoprostol causes cramping and bleeding, which empties your uterus.

If you don’t have any bleeding within 24 hours after taking the second medicine, call your nurse or doctor.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/the-abortion-pill
How do I know if the abortion pill worked?,"Abortion pills work really well. Exactly how well depends on how far along you are in your pregnancy when you take the medicine, and how many doses of misoprostol you take. Abortion pills usually work — but if they don’t, you can take more medicine or have an in-clinic abortion to complete the abortion.

If you get your abortion pills from a health care provider like Planned Parenthood, they may give you a special, extra-sensitive pregnancy test to use after your abortion. You may also be able to get an ultrasound or blood test to confirm that the abortion worked. Your nurse or doctor will also talk you through everything you need to know.

Regular pregnancy tests that you get at the store and some health centers may give you a false positive result for up to 5 weeks after your abortion — that’s because it takes a while for the pregnancy hormones to leave your body, and the test can pick those up, but it doesn’t mean you’re pregnant.

However, it IS possible to get pregnant very soon after an abortion — even if pregnancy tests are coming up positive or your period hasn’t started yet. So if you’ve had sex without using birth control since having an abortion, a positive pregnancy test could mean that you’re pregnant again.

If you’re not on hormonal birth control, you should have a period within 8 weeks after your abortion. If you’re not using hormonal birth control and you don’t get your period 8 weeks after your abortion, call your doctor or a Planned Parenthood health center.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/the-abortion-pill
What happens during a medication abortion using only misoprostol?," Your doctor or nurse will give you detailed directions about when and how to take the pills. 

You will take 3-4 doses of misoprostol. Misoprostol causes cramping and bleeding that empties your uterus. The pregnancy tissue will come out through your vagina — it’s like having an early miscarriage or a really heavy period.

Some people may need to take more misoprostol. If your doctor or nurse told you that you need another dose, take 4 more pills 3 hours later. 

It’s best to keep taking the pills the same way for each dose. But if that’s not really possible because you’re bleeding too much, or feel too nauseous, you can switch to a different way of taking them.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/the-abortion-pill
What happens after I take the misoprostol pills?,"Misoprostol causes strong cramping and bleeding in your uterus that makes the pregnancy come out through your vagina — similar to a heavy period or early miscarriage. 

You should expect cramping and bleeding to start within an hour after you take the second dose, but sometimes it can take until shortly after the third dose or longer. 

It’s normal to see large blood clots (up to the size of a lemon) or clumps of tissue during the abortion. But the pregnancy itself is very small — at 8 weeks, an embryo is about ¼ to ½ inch long. You may not see it when it comes out, especially if you’re less than 8 weeks pregnant.

The cramping and bleeding can last for several hours. It’s heaviest when the pregnancy comes out, and it will start to slow down after that. Most people finish passing the pregnancy tissue in 4-5 hours, but it may take longer. You may have cramping on and off for 1 or 2 more days.

If you don’t have any bleeding within 24 hours after taking the last dose of misoprostol, call your nurse or doctor.

It’s common to have side effects like nausea, diarrhea, and sometimes vomiting from the misoprostol. Anti-nausea medicine can help with this.

What are the possible risks of taking the abortion pill?,"Medication abortion has been used safely in the U.S. for more than 20 years. Serious complications are really rare, but can happen. These include:

the abortion pills don’t work and the pregnancy doesn’t end

some of the pregnancy tissue is left in your uterus

blood clots in your uterus

bleeding too much or too long

infection

allergic reaction to one of the medicines  

These problems aren’t common. And if they do happen, they’re usually easy to take care of with medicine or other treatments.

In extremely rare cases, some complications can be very serious or even life threatening. Call your doctor or health center right away if you:

have no bleeding within 24 hours after you take misoprostol

have heavy bleeding from your vagina that soaks through more than 2 maxi pads in an hour, for 2 or more hours in a row

pass large clots (bigger than a lemon) for more than 2 hours

have belly pain or cramps that don’t get better with pain medication

have a fever of 100.4 or higher more than 24 hours after taking misoprostol

have weakness, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea that lasts more than 24 hours after taking misoprostol

You should start to feel better the day after your abortion. Feeling sick with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, belly pain, or a fever for more than 24 hours after taking misoprostol can be a sign of infection. Call your doctor or nurse right away if you have any of those symptoms. Serious problems can cause death in the most rare cases, but abortion is typically very safe. In fact, pregnancy and childbirth is riskier than most abortions.

If you have complications during your medication abortion, you may have to go back to the doctor’s office or health center. In the unlikely event that you are still pregnant, your doctor or nurse will discuss your options with you. You may need another dose of medicine or to have an in-clinic abortion to end the pregnancy.  

Like all medications, the abortion pill isn’t right for everyone. The abortion pill may not be right for you if you have certain medical conditions or take certain medications. Your doctor or nurse will talk with you and help you decide if the abortion pill is the right option for you.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/the-abortion-pill/how-safe-is-the-abortion-pill
Does the abortion pill have long-term side effects?,"Medication abortion is really safe and effective. It’s a super common way to have an abortion, and millions of people have used it safely.

Unless there’s a rare and serious complication that’s not treated, there’s no risk to your future pregnancies or to your overall health. Having an abortion doesn’t increase your risk for breast cancer or affect your fertility. It doesn’t cause problems for future pregnancies like birth defects, premature birth or low birth weight, ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, or infant death.

Serious, long-term emotional problems after an abortion are rare, and about as uncommon as they are after giving birth. They are more likely to happen in people who have to end a pregnancy because of health reasons, people who don't have support around their decision to have an abortion, or people who have a history of mental health problems. 

Studies show that most people feel relief after an abortion, but it’s also normal to have a range of emotions — everybody’s experience is different",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/the-abortion-pill/how-safe-is-the-abortion-pill
"What’s a self-managed abortion?
","Finding and taking abortion pills to end a pregnancy without the help of a doctor or nurse is called “self-managed abortion” (which some people call an “at-home abortion”). Research shows that self-managing an abortion with abortion pills (mifepristone and/or misoprostol) can be safe and effective. This is especially true for people who: 

Usually have regular periods, are fairly sure of the first day of their last period, and are less than 10 weeks from the first day of their last period
Have access to good information about how to take the pills
Don’t have medical reasons why they shouldn’t use the pills (like inherited bleeding disorders, heart or kidney disease, still have an IUD in place, or think you have an ectopic pregnancy)
Could get to urgent care, if needed
As it gets harder for so many people to access abortion due to state laws, more and more people may choose self-managed abortion for lots of different reasons, like because they can’t afford to travel for care. 

Plan C has more information about the difference between getting an abortion from a doctor or nurse, like the staff at your local Planned Parenthood, and a self-managed abortion.

But, there may be legal risks to buying and using abortion pills outside of the health care system. Repro Legal Helpline has more information about this.

After taking abortion pills, it’s normal to have fever, chills, nausea, strong cramping and heavy bleeding for a day. If you’ve used abortion pills and have symptoms that worry you, like soaking more than 2 maxi pads an hour for more than 2 hours in a row, heavy bleeding for several days that causes dizziness, chills, and/or fever lasting more than 24 hours, go to an emergency room. Emergency doctors and nurses can care for you whether or not they know about a self-managed abortion. In fact, the symptoms after taking abortion pills are the same as a miscarriage. That information should make no difference in your treatment.

Remember that if you have any concerns about your health, including any symptoms you’re experiencing during or after an abortion, your local Planned Parenthood is available to help you, even if we didn’t provide your abortion.

How do I get help paying for my abortion?,"You may be able to have some or all of the cost of your abortion covered by your health insurance, depending on your plan and where you get your abortion. Call your nearest Planned Parenthood health center to find out if your insurance can help lower the cost of your abortion. Our staff can also let you know if there is financial assistance available for your abortion and other related costs, like transportation.

Some government health insurance plans (like Medicaid) in certain states cover abortion, while others don’t. Some plans only cover abortion in certain cases. 

Abortion funds may also be able to help you pay for your abortion. Abortion funds may also offer help with transportation, lodging, childcare, and other resources you may need to access abortion. The National Network of Abortion Funds connects people with organizations that can provide financial and logistical support for people getting abortions in the U.S. Just keep in mind that you need to already have an appointment scheduled in order to search for funding.

What is the birth control implant?,"The birth control implant (AKA Nexplanon) is a tiny, thin rod about the size of a matchstick. The implant releases hormones into your body that prevent you from getting pregnant. A nurse or doctor inserts the implant into your arm and that’s it — you’re protected from pregnancy for up to 5 years. It’s get-it-and-forget-it birth control.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-implant-nexplanon
How does the implant work?,"The birth control implant is a tiny, thin rod about the size of a matchstick. It’s also called Nexplanon and there’s a slightly older version called Implanon. A doctor inserts the implant under the skin of your upper arm. It releases the hormone progestin to stop you from getting pregnant.

The hormones in the birth control implant prevent pregnancy in two ways:

Progestin thickens the mucus on your cervix, which stops sperm from swimming through to your egg. When sperm can’t meet up with an egg, pregnancy can’t happen.

Progestin can also stop eggs from leaving your ovaries (called ovulation), so there’s no egg to fertilize. When eggs aren’t released, you can’t get pregnant.

One of the awesome things about the implant is that it lasts for a long time — up to 5 years — but it’s not permanent. If you decide you want to get pregnant or you just don’t want to have your implant anymore, your doctor can take it out. You’re able to get pregnant quickly after the implant is removed. You can keep track of your insertion and removal dates using our birth control app.

Does the implant prevent STDs?,"Nope. Nexplanon doesn't protect against STDs. Luckily, using condoms or internal condoms every time you have sex does lower your chances of getting or spreading STDs. So using condoms with your implant is the best way to prevent infections.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-implant-nexplanon/how-effective-is-the-birth-control-implant
How effective is the implant?,"The implant is one of the best birth control methods out there — it’s more than 99% effective. That means fewer than 1 out of 100 people who use Nexplanon will get pregnant each year. It doesn’t get much better than that.

The implant is so effective because there's no chance of making a mistake. Since it’s in your arm, you can’t forget to take it, or use it incorrectly. It protects you from pregnancy all day, every day for up to 5 years. If you decide you want to get pregnant, a nurse or doctor can take it out and you can get pregnant right away.

The implant doesn’t protect you from STDs, so use condoms along with the implant to help protect you from both pregnancy and STDs. That’s how you make sex worry-free.

How long does it take for the birth control implant to work?,"If you get Nexplanon during the first 5 days of your period, you’re protected from pregnancy right away.  

If you get the implant at any other time in your cycle, use some other form of birth control (like condoms) during the first week. After that first week, the implant starts working and you’re protected from pregnancy for up to 5 years. That’s why it’s called get-it-and-forget-it birth control.

Do antibiotics affect Nexplanon?,"Common antibiotics, like amoxicillin, won’t change the effectiveness of nexplanon. The antibiotic rifampin (also known as Rifadin and Rimactane) is the only exception — it can lower the effectiveness of nexplanon and other birth control methods. Rifampin is an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis. 

Some other medicines can make nexplanon less effective. It’s important to let your nurse or doctor know about any drugs and medicines you take — prescription, over-the-counter, recreational, vitamins, and herbal supplements — before they prescribe anything new for you.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-implant-nexplanon/how-effective-is-the-birth-control-implant
How much does a birth control implant cost?,"Getting your birth control implant — also called Nexplanon — can cost anywhere between $0 and $2,300. Implant removal can cost between $0 and $300. But the good news is that implants are totally free (or low cost) with most health insurance plans, Medicaid, and some other government programs.

Even if the implant costs more than other methods up-front, it ends up saving you money in the long run because it lasts for 5 years.

If you’re worried about cost, check with your local Planned Parenthood health center to find out if they can help you get birth control that fits your budget.

Planned Parenthood can also help you get health insurance — under the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare), most insurance plans must cover birth control with no out-of-pocket cost to you.

What birth control implant side effects should I expect?,"The hormones in the birth control implant may cause side effects in some people, but this doesn’t happen to everyone — many people use the implant with no problems at all. Negative side effects usually go away after a few months, once your body gets used to your implant. So if you just got the implant and you have side effects that bother you, try to stick it out and give your body a chance to adjust to the hormones. 

The most common birth control implant side effect is spotting (light bleeding or brown discharge), especially in the first 6-12 months. Sometimes the implant causes long-term spotting, or periods can get longer and heavier. But for most people, the implant makes their periods way lighter. And some people even stop getting a period at all while they’re on the implant (don’t worry, this is totally safe).

Other possible side effects that aren’t as common include:

Headaches

Breast pain

Nausea

Weight gain

Ovarian cysts

Pain or bruising on your arm where the implant was inserted

An infection where the implant was inserted

If you don’t like the way the implant makes you feel after you've had it for a few months, talk with a nurse or doctor, like the ones at your local Planned Parenthood health center. They may suggest a different birth control method. Many people try a few different types of birth control before finding the right one for them. And remember: if you get the implant taken out and don’t use another birth control method, you’ll be at risk for pregnancy right away.

The hormones in the implant and other types of birth control have been around for decades, and millions of people have used them safely. Nexplanon side effects aren’t dangerous (though there are some possible risks with using the implant, like with any medicine). You can always call a nurse or doctor, like the ones at your local Planned Parenthood health center, if you have any concerns. And you can keep track of any potential side effects with our birth control app.

The hormones in the implant can help with painful or heavy periods. The implant may ease cramps and PMS, and it will usually make your period lighter. 1 in 3 people even stop getting their period altogether after a year on the implant.

It’s totally safe to not get a period while you’re on the implant. And you don’t need to worry about being pregnant even if you don’t get a period, because the implant is really good birth control — it’s more than 99% effective at preventing pregnancy.

What are the Nexplanon side effects after removal?,"Any time there’s a change in your hormones — like when you go on or off hormonal birth control such as the implant — there’s a chance of temporary side effects. But they usually go away after a few months.

When you go off the implant, your body will eventually return to the way it was before you went on it. So if you stopped getting your period on the implant, your period will eventually come back after the implant is out. It can also take a few months for your period to go back to the cycle you had before you got the implant (but you can still get pregnant during this time).

Everyone’s body is different, and our bodies also change over time. So there’s no way to know exactly how your body will react to going off the implant. But any negative side effects that you may have will go away within a few months as your body gets used to being off the hormones.

Another important thing to note: you can get pregnant right away once the implant is out of your body (even if your periods aren’t regular). So if you stop using the implant but you don’t want to get pregnant, make sure to use another birth control method.

If you’re really worried about the side effects of going off the implant, talk with your nurse or doctor.

The birth control implant (AKA Nexplanon) may cause weight gain in some people while they’re using it, but this doesn’t happen to everyone. It’s not a very common side effect, and many people use the implant without gaining weight.

Everyone’s body is different, so birth control affects everyone a little differently. But birth control shouldn’t cause problems in your everyday life — it’s there to help you. So if you think the implant makes you gain weight and this bothers you, or if you notice other side effects that you don’t like, talk with a nurse or doctor (like the ones at your closest Planned Parenthood health center).

Many people try a few different methods before finding one that works well for them. 

Once the implant is out of your arm, any side effects you had will fade. So if the implant causes you to gain weight, that should stop shortly after having the implant removed.

Most of the time you can’t see the implant under your skin, so nobody knows you have it unless you tell them.

Implants make your periods better.
Nexplanon can help cut down on period cramps. It also makes your period way lighter — and 1 in 3 people with the implant stop getting their periods at all after a year.

Implants only have one hormone.
Many hormonal birth control methods contain two hormones, estrogen and progestin.  Some people with certain health problems can’t use methods that contain estrogen. Nexplanon is super effective at preventing pregnancy AND it’s estrogen-free, so more people are able to use it.

You can get pregnant after taking out your implant.
Nexplanon is reversible. If you decide you want to get pregnant, you can get it removed at any time. The birth control implant won’t affect your fertility or make it harder to get pregnant in the future. In fact, it’s possible to get pregnant as soon as your implant is out.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-implant-nexplanon/what-are-the-benefits-of-using-the-birth-control-implant
What are the disadvantages of birth control implants?,"The implant can have negative side effects.
Like all medicines, there can be side effects with the implant. But many people adjust to the implant with no problems. Negative side effects usually go away after a few months, once your body gets used to your implant. You can use our birth control app to keep track of the side effects you may be having. 

The most common side effect is irregular bleeding (aka spotting), especially in the first 6-12 months. But most people on the implant get lighter periods, or their periods stop altogether while they have the implant. Other possible side effects that aren’t as common include headaches, breast pain, and nausea. There may also be temporary pain, bruising, or an infection on your arm where you got the implant.

Birth control shouldn’t make you feel bad. Luckily, there are many different types of birth control, so you’ve got options. If you keep having side effects that bother you, talk with your nurse or doctor about trying another birth control method.

Birth control implants don’t protect against STDs.
Birth control implants are one of the best methods of birth control out there, but they don’t protect you from sexually transmitted infections. Luckily, using condoms every time you have sex really reduces your chances of getting or spreading STDs. So using condoms + Nexplanon is the best way to protect yourself from pregnancy and STDs.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-implant-nexplanon/what-are-the-benefits-of-using-the-birth-control-implant
When should I get the birth control implant removed?,"Nexplanon works for 5 years, and a nurse or doctor must remove it once it expires. You can also get your implant taken out any time before then if you want to get pregnant or stop using it.

If you’ve had your implant for 5 years and you still don’t want to get pregnant, you need to replace it (or pick another birth control method). You can get a new implant when you have the old one removed.

How does it feel to get the birth control implant removed?,"Nexplanon removal only takes a few minutes, but the process is a little longer than getting it put in.

Just like with the insertion, a doctor or nurse gives you a shot to numb a small area of your arm. Then they make a small cut and remove the implant. You usually just feel a little pinch or stinging when you get the numbing shot. After that, it shouldn’t hurt when they make the incision or take the implant out.

If you want to continue using Nexplanon, you can get another implant put in during the removal of your old one.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-implant-nexplanon/what-are-the-benefits-of-using-the-birth-control-implant

What should I expect after I get my implant removed?,"Overall, you should feel completely normal after getting your implant taken out. Your arm may feel tender or swollen around where the implant was for a few days.  It may look bruised for a week or two. Your doctor or nurse will tell you how to wash and take care of your skin for a couple of days after removal. 

Any side effects that you may have had while on the implant will eventually go away after the implant is out. Unless you start another hormonal birth control method after removing the implant, your period will go back to how it was before you got Nexplanon. You can keep track of your period after removal using our app.

What’s an IUD?,"An IUD is a tiny device that's put into your uterus to prevent pregnancy. It’s long-term, reversible, and one of the most effective birth control methods out there.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/iud
What does IUD stand for?,"IUD stands for Intrauterine Device (basically: a device inside your uterus). It's a small piece of flexible plastic shaped like a T. Sometimes it’s called an IUC — intrauterine contraception.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/iud/
What are the types of IUDs?,"There are 5 different brands of IUDs that are FDA approved for use in the United States:

Paragard
Mirena
Kyleena
Liletta
Skyla
These IUDs are divided into 2 types:

hormonal IUDs (Mirena, Kyleena, Liletta, and Skyla).
copper IUDs (Paragard) and
The Paragard IUD doesn’t have hormones. It’s wrapped in a tiny bit of copper, and it protects you from pregnancy for up to 12 years.

The Mirena, Kyleena, Liletta, and Skyla IUDs use the hormone progestin to prevent pregnancy. Progestin is very similar to the hormone progesterone that our bodies make naturally. Mirena works for up to 8 years. Kyleena works for up to 5 years. Liletta works for up to 8 years. Skyla works for up to 3 years.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/iud/
How do IUDs work?,"Both copper IUDs and hormonal IUDs prevent pregnancy by changing the way sperm cells move so they can't get to an egg. If sperm can’t make it to an egg, pregnancy can’t happen.

The Paragard IUD uses copper to prevent pregnancy. Sperm doesn’t like copper, so the Paragard IUD makes it almost impossible for sperm to get to that egg.

The hormones in the Mirena, Kyleena, Liletta, and Skyla IUDs prevent pregnancy in two ways: 1) they thicken the mucus that lives on the cervix, which blocks and traps the sperm, and 2) the hormones also sometimes stop eggs from leaving your ovaries (called ovulation), which means there’s no egg for a sperm to fertilize. No egg, no pregnancy.

One of the awesome things about IUDs is that they last for years — but they’re not permanent. If you decide to get pregnant or you just don’t want to have your IUD anymore, your nurse or doctor can quickly and easily take it out. You’re able to get pregnant right after the IUD is removed.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/iud/
Can IUDs be used as emergency contraception?,"Yes! The Paragard, Mirena, and Liletta IUDs work super well as emergency contraception. If you get one of these IUDs put in within 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected sex, it’s more than 99% effective. It’s actually the most effective way to prevent pregnancy after sex.

Another great thing about using an IUD as emergency contraception: you can keep it and have really effective birth control that you can use for up to 8 to12 years (depending on which kind you get). The other kind of emergency contraception is the morning-after pill. You can take it up to 5 days after unprotected sex to reduce the risk of pregnancy.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/iud/
How effective are IUDs when used as birth control?,"IUDs are one of the best birth control methods out there — more than 99% effective. That means fewer than 1 out of 100 people who use an IUD will get pregnant each year.

IUDs are so effective because there's no chance of making a mistake. You can’t forget to take it (like the pill), or use it incorrectly (like condoms). And you're protected from pregnancy 24/7 for 3 to 12 years, depending on which kind you get.

How much does an IUD cost?,"Getting an IUD costs anywhere between $0 to $1,800. That’s a pretty wide range, but the good news is that IUDs can be free or low cost with many health insurance plans, Medicaid, and some other government programs.

Prices can also vary depending on which kind you get. The price of an IUD includes medical exams, getting the IUD put in, and follow-up visits.

Even if an IUD costs more than other methods up front, they usually end up saving you money in the long run because they last for years.

Can I get an IUD for free or low-cost?,"There's a good chance you can get an IUD for free (or for a reduced price) if you have health insurance. Because of the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare), most insurance plans must cover all methods of birth control, including IUDs.

However, some plans don’t cover all brands of IUDs. Your health insurance provider can tell you which ones they pay for. Your doctor may also be able to help you get your birth control method of choice covered by health insurance. Learn more about health insurance and affordable birth control.

If you don't have health insurance, you've still got options. Depending on your income and legal status in the U.S., you may qualify for Medicaid or other state programs that can help you pay for birth control and other health care.

You can contact your gynecologist, family planning clinics, or your nearest Planned Parenthood health center to find out more about getting an IUD.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/iud/how-can-i-get-an-iud
How is an IUD put in?,"First, your nurse or doctor will ask you some questions about your medical history. Then they’ll check your vagina, cervix, and uterus, and they may test you for STDs. You may be offered medicine to help open and/or numb your cervix before the IUD is put in. 

To put the IUD in, the nurse or doctor will put a speculum into your vagina and then use a special inserter to put the IUD in through the opening of your cervix and into your uterus. The process usually takes less than five minutes.

IUDs can be put in at any point in your menstrual cycle, and you can usually get one put in right after giving birth or having an abortion.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/iud/whats-an-iud-insertion-like
How does it feel to get an IUD put in?,"People usually feel some cramping or pain when they're getting their IUD placed. The pain can be worse for some than for others. The pain during IUD placement may be more intense if you have never experienced childbirth or if you have previous experiences of trauma, depression, or anxiety. IUDs can be placed with or without medicines to help with the pain, and there are a few different types of medicines that can be used.

Some doctors or nurses tell you to take pain medicine before you get the IUD to help reduce pain from cramps during or after placement. Some people might get medicine that either makes you relax or puts you to sleep completely. Some doctors or nurses also might inject or use a local numbing medicine around your cervix to make it more comfortable. 

If you want to get any of these medicines when you get your IUD placed, you should talk to  your nurse or doctor before your appointment. You can let them know how you experience pain, any concerns you may have about getting the IUD placed, and if you would like to have medicines to manage the pain before, during, and/or after getting it placed. They can let you know what medicines they are able to offer you so you can decide if they are the nurse or doctor that you would like to get your IUD with.   

Some people feel dizzy during or right after the IUD is put in, and there's a small chance of fainting. You might want to ask someone to come with you to the appointment so you don't have to drive or go home alone, and to give yourself some time to relax afterward.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/iud/whats-an-iud-insertion-like
What can I expect after an IUD insertion procedure?,"Many people feel perfectly fine right after they get an IUD, while others need to take it easy for a while. There can be some cramping and backaches, so plan on chilling at home after your appointment — it’s a great excuse to curl up on the couch with your favorite book or movie. Heating pads and over-the-counter pain meds can help ease cramps too.

You may have cramping and spotting after getting an IUD, but this almost always goes away within 3-6 months. Hormonal IUDs eventually make periods lighter and less crampy, and you might stop getting a period at all. On the flip side, copper IUDs may make periods heavier and cramps worse. For some people, this goes away over time. If your IUD is causing you pain, discomfort, or side effects you don’t like, call your doctor.

Once you get the IUD, a string about 1 or 2 inches long will come out of your cervix and into the top of your vagina; don’t worry, you won’t notice it. The string is there so a nurse or doctor can remove the IUD later. You can feel the string by putting your fingers in your vagina and reaching up toward your cervix. But DON’T tug on the string, because you could move your IUD out of place or pull it out.

There's a very small chance that your IUD could slip out of place. It can happen any time, but it's more common during the first 3 months. IUDs are most likely to come out during your period. Check your pads, tampons, or cups to see if it fell out. You can also check your string to make sure it’s still there. If your IUD falls out, you’re NOT protected from pregnancy, so make sure to go see your doctor, and use condoms or another kind of birth control in the meantime.

Remember when you got your IUD (or write it down somewhere), so you’ll know when it needs to be replaced. The Paragard IUD should be replaced after 12 years. Mirena should be replaced after 8 years. Kyleena should be replaced after 5 years. Liletta should be replaced after 8 years. Skyla should be replaced after 3 years.

How soon after getting an IUD can I have sex?,"You can have sex as soon as you want after getting an IUD.

You might need to use a backup method of birth control (like condoms) until the IUD starts to work — whether you're protected against pregnancy right away depends on what type of IUD you get and when it’s put in your uterus.

Paragard (copper), Mirena, and Liletta IUDs start working to prevent pregnancy as soon as they're in place.

Kyleena and Skyla IUDs start working to prevent pregnancy right away IF they’re put in during the first 7 days of your period. If you get a Kyleena or Skyla IUD at any other time during your cycle, protection starts after 7 days — in the meantime, use condoms or another kind of birth control to prevent pregnancy.

What hormonal IUD side effects should I expect?,"Hormonal IUDs (like Mirena, Kyleena, Liletta, and Skyla) can cause side effects. But for most people, that’s actually a good thing —  the most common hormonal IUD side effects usually help make your periods better.

Hormonal IUDs can cut down on cramps and PMS, and they usually make your periods much lighter. Some people stop getting their periods at all while they have their IUD (don’t worry, this is totally normal and safe). In fact, many people get hormonal IUDs to help with heavy or painful periods, to treat symptoms of endometriosis or PCOS, or because they just don’t want to bleed every month. 

Other hormonal IUD side effects can include:

Pain when the IUD is put in, and cramping or back aches for a few days after

spotting between periods

irregular periods

These usually go away within 3–6 months, once your body gets used to the new visitor in your uterus. And they don’t happen to everyone — many people use hormonal IUDs with no problems at all.

Over-the-counter pain medicine (like ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin) can usually help with IUD cramps. If you have cramping that doesn’t get better or is really painful, talk with your nurse or doctor. They may need to check to make sure that your IUD is in the right place. 

The changes in your periods while you have your IUD can make some people worry about how they’ll know they’re not pregnant. But you don’t really need to worry about being pregnant even if you don’t get a period, because the IUD is really good at what it does — it’s more than 99% effective at preventing pregnancy. 

If you do think you might be pregnant, take a pregnancy test and call your nurse or doctor right away if it’s positive. It’s very rare to get pregnant while you have an IUD, but if it does happen, it’s more likely to be an ectopic pregnancy, which can be dangerous and needs medical attention right away.

The hormones in these IUDs and other types of hormonal birth control (like the implant and shot) have been around for decades, and millions of people have used them safely. Hormonal IUD side effects aren’t dangerous, though there are some possible risks with using IUDs, like with any medicine. You can always call a nurse or doctor, like the ones at your local Planned Parenthood health center, if you have any concerns.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/iud/iud-side-effects
What copper IUD side effects should I expect?,"The copper IUD (aka Paragard IUD) has no hormones, so you don’t have to deal with any of the risks or side effects that can sometimes happen with hormonal birth control methods.

Paragard side effects can include:

spotting between periods

irregular periods

heavier or longer periods

more or worse cramping during your periods

pain when your IUD is put in, and cramping or back aches for a few days after 

Over-the-counter pain medicine can help with IUD cramps. And the cramping and bleeding usually get better after a few months, once your body gets used to your IUD. You can keep track of any side effects you may be having with our birth control app.

Are there IUD removal side effects?,"You may have some spotting for a little while after your nurse or doctor takes out your IUD, but otherwise you should feel totally normal.

When you stop using an IUD, your body will eventually return to the way it was before you got it. So if your period got heavier on the copper IUD, it will go back to what was normal for you before you got the IUD. If you stopped getting your period on the hormonal IUD, your period will eventually come back after the IUD is out. It can take a few months for your period to go back to what’s normal for you.

An important thing to note: you can get pregnant right away once your IUD is out, even if your periods aren’t regular or haven’t come back yet. So if you have your IUD removed but you don’t want to get pregnant, make sure to use another birth control method.

Everyone’s body is different, and our bodies also change over time. So there’s no way to know exactly how your body will react to going off the IUD. But any side effects that you may have will go away within a few months as your body gets used to not having an IUD anymore.

There are 2 methods of birth control that may cause weight gain in some people who use them: the birth control shot and the birth control implant. But this doesn’t happen to everybody who uses these types of birth control. Many people use the shot or the implant without gaining weight.

have certain STDs or pelvic infection

think you might be pregnant

have cervical cancer that hasn't been treated

have cancer of the uterus

have had a pelvic infection after either childbirth or an abortion in the past 3 months

You also shouldn't get a Paragard IUD if you have a copper allergy, Wilson's Disease, or a bleeding disorder that makes it hard for your blood to clot. If you have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), you’re at higher risk for extra heavy bleeding on Paragard.

Don’t get a hormonal IUD if you’ve had breast cancer. If you have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and you have antiphospholipid antibodies (or if you don’t know), you’re at higher risk for serious blood clots while using a hormonal IUD.

The IUD can sometimes slip out of your uterus — it can come all the way out or just a little bit. If this happens, you can get pregnant. If the IUD only comes out part of the way, a nurse or doctor has to remove it.

Don’t use a menstrual cup with an IUD. Using a menstrual cup can cause your IUD to move out of place. If you do decide to use a menstrual cup, you need to check your IUD strings monthly, and contact your nurse or doctor if your IUD strings are missing.

It’s possible — though extremely unlikely — to get pregnant even if your IUD is in the right spot. If you get pregnant, a nurse or doctor will need to remove your IUD as soon as possible. If you get pregnant with an IUD in place, there’s an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy and other serious health problems.

It’s possible to get an infection if bacteria gets into your uterus when the IUD is put in. If the infection isn't treated, it may make it harder for you to get pregnant in the future.

When the nurse or doctor puts the IUD in, it could push through the wall of your uterus. This sounds painful, but it usually doesn't hurt. But if this happens, you may need surgery to remove the IUD. However, this is very rare.

It’s also possible for an IUD to get stuck in the wall of your uterus, and your nurse or doctor may need to use an instrument to remove it (or rarely, you may need a surgical procedure). The IUD may break, or the copper on a non-hormonal IUD may fall off  — to treat this, your nurse or doctor may just watch and wait for a while, use an instrument to remove it, or do a surgical procedure to remove it.

Some people have side effects after getting an IUD. Hormonal IUDs and copper (non-hormonal) IUDs have different side effects.

Your side effects will probably ease up after about 3–6 months, once your body gets used to your IUD. So if you can stick it out for a few months, there’s a good chance any side effects you’re having will eventually go away or be less noticeable. You can keep track of any side effects you're experiencing with our birth control app. If you’re still having pain or other side effects that bother you after a while, or your side effects are really bad, talk with your nurse or doctor.

IUDs don’t protect against STDs.
While IUDs are one of the best ways to prevent pregnancy, they don't protect you from sexually transmitted infections. Luckily, using condoms every time you have sex reduces the chance of getting or spreading STDs. So the thing to do is to use condoms with your IUD.

There are some risks with the IUD, but they’re rare.
Serious problems from IUDs are not at all common, but there are some risks and warning signs to look out for.

IUD insertion can hurt, but the pain doesn’t last long
The process of getting your IUD placed can be painful for some people. It usually feels like strong period cramps. But the good news is, it’s really quick — the worst part is usually over in less than a minute, and then you’ve got really effective birth control that you don’t have to think about for several years. If you’re worried about pain, ask your nurse or doctor about medicine or other ways to help when you make your appointment.

Even if the insertion is not exactly a fun time, lots of IUD users think it’s totally worth it in the end. Hormonal IUDs usually make your periods much lighter and less crampy. And for people who can’t use or don’t want to use hormonal methods (but still want super-effective, non-permanent birth control), copper IUDs are a really great option. So many people are willing to deal with a few minutes of pain in exchange for years of really effective birth control along with the other benefits of IUDs.

Does the copper IUD make you gain weight?,"Nope! The copper IUD (Paragard) doesn’t cause weight gain.

Because the copper IUD is hormone-free, it doesn’t have many side effects at all. Some people do have heavier, longer periods and more cramping, especially for the first few months.

Remember — everyone has a different reaction to each type of birth control, so it’s about finding what works best for you and your lifestyle. That’s why it’s important to talk with your doctor or nurse and be patient. It might take a few tries to find your perfect method.

Because of the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare), most health insurance plans must cover all doctor’s visits related to birth control, including IUD removal. You can call the number on the back of your health insurance card or talk with your nurse or doctor if you have questions. Learn more about health insurance and affordable birth control.

If you don't have health insurance, you still have options. Depending on your income and legal status in the U.S., you may be able to enroll in Medicaid or other programs that can help you pay for your IUD removal and other health care.

Planned Parenthood health centers work to provide you with the services you need, whether or not you have insurance. Most Planned Parenthood health centers accept Medicaid and health insurance, and many charge less for services depending on your income.

Can I remove my IUD at home?
","It’s best to have a nurse or doctor take out your IUD. IUD removal is usually a pretty simple process, but there’s a chance you could hurt yourself if you try to take your own IUD out.

Very rarely, there can be complications during an IUD removal — the IUD may be embedded (stuck) in the tissue in your uterus, it may have moved, or a piece may break off. This is super uncommon, but if a complication does happen, a nurse or doctor will know what to do to safely remove your IUD.

So try to have a nurse or doctor remove your IUD if you can.

How do hormonal IUDs work?,"IUD stands for Intrauterine Device — a birth control method that sits inside your uterus. A hormonal IUD is a small piece of flexible plastic shaped like a T. The hormonal IUD releases a tiny amount of the hormone progestin into your body over several years. Progestin is very similar to the hormone progesterone that our bodies make naturally.

The hormones in the IUD help prevent pregnancy, and can also help with painful or heavy periods while you’re using it.

Hormonal IUDs prevent pregnancy by keeping sperm cells away from your eggs. If sperm can’t make it to an egg, pregnancy can’t happen. The hormones in the IUD prevent pregnancy in two ways:

1) Hormonal IUDs make the mucus on your cervix thicker. This mucus blocks sperm so it can’t get to an egg.

2) The hormones in the IUD can also stop eggs from leaving your ovaries (called ovulation), which means there’s no egg for a sperm to fertilize. No egg = no pregnancy.

One of the awesome things about IUDs is that they last for years, but they’re not permanent. If you decide that you want to get pregnant, or if you just don’t want to have your IUD anymore, your nurse or doctor can take it out. After you get your IUD removed, your fertility goes back to what's normal for you.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/iud/hormonal-iuds
What are the kinds of hormonal IUDs?,"There are four brands of hormonal IUDs available in the U.S.: Mirena, Kyleena, Liletta, and Skyla. They all work the same and have the same kind of hormone in them. Different hormonal IUDs last for different lengths of time: the Mirena and Liletta IUDs work for up to 8 years. Kyleena works for up to 5 years. Skyla works for up to 3 years.

You don’t have to keep your IUD for that many years though — you can get your IUD taken out whenever you want. If your IUD is going to expire but you want to keep using an IUD, your nurse or doctor can replace it.

Hormonal IUDs can cut down on cramps and make your period way lighter. Some people stop getting their periods at all while they have the IUD. Hormonal IUDs can also help treat the symptoms of things like endometriosis and PCOS.

There are lots of other benefits to IUDs. They’re super convenient — once your IUD is in place, you don’t have to think about birth control for several years.

Mirena hormones are the same as in all other hormonal IUDs — Mirena uses progestin to prevent pregnancy and make your periods lighter and less painful. Liletta, Kyleena, and Skyla also have progestin in them. 

Some hormonal IUDs have a little bit more progestin than others. But the amount of hormones in an IUD only affects how long it lasts — it doesn’t change how well your IUD prevents pregnancy. All hormonal IUDs are more than 99% effective at preventing pregnancy.

How can sex lead to STDs?,"Anybody who has sex may be at risk for sexually transmitted infections and/or pregnancy.

Sexually transmitted infections can be spread during many kinds of sexual activity: like oral sex, anal sex, vaginal sex, and skin-to-skin genital touching (AKA dry humping without clothes). Some infections are spread through body fluids like semen, vaginal fluids, and blood. Others can be passed when the skin of your mouth or genitals rubs against the skin of someone else’s genitals.

So pretty much any type of sexual contact with another person — where there’s body fluids or genital skin touching — can put you at risk for STDs.

Sexually transmitted infections are super common — most people get one at some point in their life. Some STDs can be serious, but the good news is they can usually be cured or treated. If you’re having sex, protect yourself by using condoms and getting tested for STDs. Read more about STDs.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/teens/stds-birth-control-pregnancy
How can sex lead to pregnancy?,"Along with STDs, there’s also a risk for pregnancy if you have vaginal (penis-in-vagina) sex. Anytime semen (from cum or precum) from a penis gets into a vagina, pregnancy can happen. Pregnancy can also happen if semen gets on a vulva or near the vagina (like if you had wet semen on your fingers and touched a vagina).

So if you’re having vaginal sex — or think you might have sex sometime soon — use birth control (like condoms, an IUD, or the pill) if you want to prevent pregnancy. Birth control is the best way to avoid pregnancy if you have sex.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/teens/stds-birth-control-pregnancy
What’s the best way to protect myself from STDs and pregnancy?  ,"The only 100% certain way to avoid STDs is to not do any sexual stuff that involves body fluids or skin-to-skin touching with another person (including oral, anal, and vaginal sex).

And the only 100% certain way to avoid pregnancy is to not have penis-in-vagina sex, or do any sexual stuff where sperm can touch a vulva or vagina (this is called abstinence). 

But let’s get real: most people do have sex at some point in their life. And there are ways to help protect yourself from STDs and/or pregnancy if you decide to have sex.

Using safer sex barriers (like condoms and dental dams) every time you have oral, anal, or vaginal sex helps protect you from STDs. And using birth control (including condoms) every time you have penis-in-vagina sex helps prevent pregnancy.

Condoms are the only type of birth control that helps prevent pregnancy and STDs at the same time. But if you have penis-in-vagina sex, the best way to protect yourself is to use condoms PLUS another birth control method — like the pill, IUD, implant, or shot. That way you’re protected from STDs, and double-protected from pregnancy.

Do I need to worry about STDs?,"You may have heard of sexually transmitted infections like gonorrhea, chlamydia, herpes, HIV, and others. STDs are super common — most people will get one at some point in their life. And young people between the ages of 15-24 have a higher chance of getting an STD than anyone else. Some of the most common STDs (like gonorrhea and chlamydia) can be cured with antibiotics, and aren’t dangerous if you get treatment right away. But others can cause serious health problems, especially if you don’t get treatment.

Even though STDs are common, sometimes people feel a lot of shame and embarrassment when they get one. But STDs are like any other infection that gets passed from one person to another — sex just happens to be the way they’re passed.

So if you do get a STD, it doesn’t mean you’re “dirty” or a bad person. You’re just one of the millions of people who got an infection. And like other infections, there are medicines to help you stay healthy if you do get an STD.

Safer sex means using condoms, internal condoms, or dental dams. These barriers help block fluids and some skin-to-skin touching that can pass STDs. You can use condoms for vaginal sex, anal sex, and oral sex on a penis. You can use internal condoms for vaginal sex and anal sex. And you can use dental dams for oral sex on a vulva or anus. Read more about using condoms and dental dams.

Not having sex at all, or using condoms if you do have sex, are 2 of the best ways to prevent STDs. But there are other things you can do too:

Get tested for STDs. If you do have an infection, you can get treatment so you stay healthy and avoid spreading the STD to other people.

Talk to your partner. Good communication, especially about safer sex, can help you build trust and bring you closer together.

Choose sexual activities that are less risky. There are lots of ways you can be sexual and stay safe. Masturbation, dry-humping (rubbing genitals with clothes on), talking sexy, and cuddling are just some of the things that you can do that won’t spread STDs.

If your partner doesn’t want to use condoms or help prevent STDs, then they’re not respecting you. If someone really cares about you, they’ll want you to be safe. And it’s not OK for anyone to pressure you to do anything sexual you're not comfortable with, even if you really like or love each other.

How are STDs spread?,"STDs are usually spread by having vaginal sex, anal sex, or oral sex without using protection (like a condom). But it’s not always that simple — there are many STDs, and different STDs are spread in different ways.

Some infections are spread through body fluids like semen (cum), vaginal fluids, and blood. Others can also be passed when the skin of your mouth or genitals rubs against the skin of someone else’s.  

So basically: any type of sexual contact that involves body fluids or touching genitals can put you at risk for STDs. That’s why using condoms and other barriers (like dental dams) makes sex safer — they help block skin and fluids that can spread STDs.

Vaginal sex (penis-in-vagina) and anal sex (penis-in-butt) are especially risky if you don’t use a condom — using a condom makes them much safer. Oral sex (mouth on a vulva, penis, or anus) can also spread certain STDs (like herpes or HPV). Using condoms and dental dams for oral sex can help protect you and your partner.

Some STDs (like HIV) can also be spread by sharing needles (like for drugs, piercings, or tattoos), or to a baby during childbirth or breastfeeding. But you can’t get STDs from casual contact like hugging, holding hands, or toilet seats. You can only get an STD from contact with semen, vaginal fluids, blood, or skin-to-skin genital touching.

STDs can’t appear out of thin air - you can only get an STD from someone who already has one. But many people who have an STD don’t know it, because a lot of times there aren’t any symptoms.

So just looking at someone’s penis or vulva can’t tell you whether they have an STD. People with STDs may look and feel totally normal — but they can still give the infection to someone else.

Sometimes STDs do cause problems that you might notice. Get tested for STDs if you have any of these symptoms in or near your genitals:

pain

swelling

weird bumps, sores, or rashes

itching and/or burning

Pain or burning when you pee

discharge from your penis

vaginal discharge that has a different smell, color, or texture

bleeding from your genitals (that isn’t your period)

So it’s good to use condoms even if you’re on another method of birth control.

Some types of birth control work better than others. You need to see a doctor or nurse to get the types of birth control that work best to prevent pregnancy — like the IUD, implant, shot, pill, patch, or ring. You can get these kinds of birth control from your regular doctor or gynecologist, or at your nearest Planned Parenthood health center.

Usually you don’t need a full exam to get birth control. But what happens at your appointment depends on your personal health, the doctor’s policies, and the kind of birth control you want. Here’s some stuff you can expect:

Your nurse or doctor will talk with you about your medical history (ask you questions about your health in the past) and check your blood pressure. Sometimes they do a pelvic exam, but they usually don’t need to.

The nurse or doctor may ask about your sex life: whether you’ve ever had sex, what kinds of sex, how many people you’ve had sex with, if you’ve used birth control before, etc. It’s super important to be honest so they can give you the best possible care. Doctors aren’t there to judge and they’ve heard it all before — they just want to help you stay healthy.

You can also ask any questions you have about birth control. You might want to talk with your doctor about the IUD or implant — these types of birth control are the easiest to use and work the best.

If you get the IUD, implant, or shot, your doctor will give it to you in the health center. If you choose the pill, patch, or ring, you’ll probably get a prescription. You can use the prescription to pick up your birth control at a drugstore or pharmacy. Some doctors might even have pills, patches, or rings in the health center to give to you at your appointment.

If you have health insurance, you probably won’t have to pay anything for your birth control. If you don’t have health insurance, ask your local Planned Parenthood health center about how to get free or low-cost birth control.

Will your parents find out if you get birth control from your doctor? It depends on the laws where you live and/or your doctor’s policies. But many places have special laws that let teens get birth control privately. Either way, talking to your parents about birth control can be really helpful.

You can get some kinds of morning-after pills (like Plan B) at the drugstore or at your local Planned Parenthood health center without a prescription. But it’s important to take it as soon as possible after unprotected sex, or it won’t work as well. Another kind of morning-after pill, called ella, is more effective than morning-after pills like Plan B — but you need a prescription from a nurse or doctor to get it.

No matter what method you choose, you can get extra pregnancy prevention power by using birth control and a condom together.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/teens/stds-birth-control-pregnancy/whats-best-kind-birth-control
Condoms + Birth Control = Extra Protection,"Condoms are your safer sex superhero: they’re the only way to get protection from pregnancy and STDs during vaginal sex.

No birth control method is perfect. So using condoms with another type of birth control (like the implant, IUD, or pill) gives you backup protection in case either method fails. And condoms seriously lower your chances of getting all kinds of sexually transmitted infections, like HIV, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and herpes.

Another great thing about condoms is that you can get them almost anywhere, like drugstores, grocery stores, convenience stores, and gas stations. Condoms don’t cost a lot of money, and sometimes they’re even free at community clinics, school health centers, or Planned Parenthood health centers.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/teens/stds-birth-control-pregnancy/whats-best-kind-birth-control
How do I talk to my parents about birth control and STDs?,Talking to parents about sex stuff might feel awkward. But it can also be really helpful and bring you closer together. And it gets easier the more you do it.,https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/teens/stds-birth-control-pregnancy/how-do-i-talk-my-parents-about-birth-control-and-stds
How do I talk to my parents about sex?,"For some people, it’s easy to talk to their parents about sex. Other families may not be very open about these topics. Either way, it’s normal to feel a little embarrassed or anxious about bringing up sex to the adults in your life. You might worry that your parents will be angry, disappointed, or upset if you ask about birth control or STDs. But you may be surprised: most of the time parents are glad you came to them, and that you’re being responsible about protecting your health.

Your parents were your age once, and know what it’s like to be a teenager. They probably already know a lot about sex, birth control, and STDs. Even if your parents don’t have all the answers, they can help you find ways to get the information you need, or find a nurse or doctor for you to talk to.

Your parents can also help you get birth control, STD testing, and other sexual health services like the HPV vaccine. But if you really don’t feel safe talking with your parents about this stuff, you may be able to see a doctor privately (depending on where you live).",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/teens/stds-birth-control-pregnancy/how-do-i-talk-my-parents-about-birth-control-and-stds
Will my parents find out if I get birth control or STD testing?,"Most of the time you don’t need a parent’s permission to get birth control or STD testing. Many states have special parental consent laws that protect your right to get sexual health services privately, even if you’re under 18. But laws are different in every state. There are certain places where the doctor’s office can contact your parent or guardian if you’re under 18. You can ask your doctor’s office or local health center about their privacy policies when you make an appointment.  

If you use your parents’ health insurance to pay for your appointment or prescriptions, your family might get a statement in the mail that says what services you had. If you’re using someone else’s health insurance and don’t want them to know about your doctor’s visit, call the insurance company to find out about their privacy policies. The number is usually on the back of your insurance card (or you can ask your nurse or doctor).

You can also call your local Planned Parenthood health center to see if they can give you free or low cost birth control and/or STD testing, without using your parents’ insurance. And some states have special programs that allow teens to get their own private health insurance plan for birth control and STD services. Your local Planned Parenthood can help you with that, too.

Even if you’re worried about talking with your parents about birth control, it’s a good idea to ask for their help (as long as you feel safe). Parents usually just want to make sure you stay healthy and protected. And they may feel better about you getting sexual health services if they’re involved. Get more tips on talking to your parents about sex.

If you don’t feel like you can rely on your parent or guardian, talk with another trusted adult in your life — like an aunt or uncle, older brother or sister, counselor, or school nurse. And you can always call your local Planned Parenthood health center to get honest, private information about STDs and birth control.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/teens/stds-birth-control-pregnancy/how-do-i-talk-my-parents-about-birth-control-and-stds
I think I’m pregnant. Now what?,"A surprise pregnancy can be stressful and scary. You’re the only one who can decide what to do, but there are people who can give you info and support. You’re not alone.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/teens/stds-birth-control-pregnancy/i-think-im-pregnant-now-what
How do I know if I’m pregnant?,"Pregnancy can only happen if semen (cum) gets in your vagina or on your vulva. So if you haven’t had penis-in-vagina sex or had any semen (cum) near your vulva since your last period, you’re not pregnant.

Also keep in mind that it takes up to a few weeks for pregnancy to happen after sex. So if the sex happened a few days ago, you can’t be pregnant yet — in fact, you can still use emergency contraception (like the morning-after pill) to help prevent pregnancy if it’s been less than 5 days since you’ve had unprotected sex.

If you’ve had penis-in-vagina sex and miss your period, it’s possible that you’re pregnant. But keep in mind that lots of things besides pregnancy can mess with the timing of your period, like stress, diet, changes in your weight, and being sick. It’s also really common to have irregular periods when you’re a teenager.

The first thing to do if you think you’re pregnant is take a pregnancy test — it’s the only way to know for sure. A pregnancy test can tell you if you’re pregnant as soon as your period is late.

Early pregnancy symptoms include bloating, sore breasts, upset stomach, and feeling tired. But these symptoms can also be caused by other things, like PMS or being sick. And some people don’t have symptoms at all in early pregnancy. So symptoms alone can’t tell you what’s going on — only a pregnancy test can.

If your pregnancy test is positive, make an appointment with your doctor or local Planned Parenthood Health Center right away so you can talk about your pregnancy options and make sure you stay healthy — no matter what you decide to do about your pregnancy. But be careful to go to a real health center and not a crisis pregnancy center — these are fake clinics that often say they offer pregnancy tests and counseling, but they don’t actually provide a full range of real health care. They won’t give you honest information about your pregnancy options, and they don’t have to follow privacy laws. Planned Parenthood can help you find somewhere trustworthy.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/teens/stds-birth-control-pregnancy/i-think-im-pregnant-now-what
I’m pregnant — what do I do now?,"Finding out you’re pregnant can feel overwhelming, but try to stay calm. You’re going to be okay, and there are people who can help you.

If you’re pregnant you have 3 options:

Parenting — giving birth and raising the child.

Abortion — ending the pregnancy.

Adoption — giving birth and placing the child with another person or family, forever.

If you think you might choose parenting or adoption, you need prenatal care to make sure you stay healthy during the pregnancy.

If you’re thinking about getting an abortion, try to make an appointment as soon as you can. It can be harder to get an abortion as time goes by. If you live in a state where abortion is illegal, you may have to go to another state to get an abortion and it can take time to arrange travel. Whatever you decide to do, go to a doctor right away so they can help you stay healthy.

The staff at your local Planned Parenthood health center can give you accurate information about all your options, answer your questions, and offer support.  You can also find a trustworthy abortion provider at AbortionFinder.org.

You can also get information and health care from other family planning centers or your family doctor. Be careful when looking for a reliable health center — there are fake clinics that say they have pregnancy services, but they don’t offer a full range of health care, and they may not even have real nurses and doctors on staff. These are called Crisis Pregnancy Centers, and they’re run by people who won’t give you truthful or accurate information about pregnancy, abortion, birth control, or sexual health. 

Talking with someone about your feelings can be helpful, too. If you can, it’s a really good idea to talk with a parent or caregiver about it — chances are they care about you and want to help you. You could also talk with another family member, boyfriend/girlfriend, friend, school counselor, religious advisor, or another adult that you trust. Choose someone who will listen to you, be supportive, respect your privacy, and won’t be judgmental or try to pressure you into anything.

If you’re having a hard time finding someone in your life to talk with, check out All-Options. All-Options has a free, private hotline where you can talk about your pregnancy and get support, no matter how you’re feeling.

No one should pressure you into making any decision about your pregnancy, no matter what. Only you know what’s right for you.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/teens/stds-birth-control-pregnancy/i-think-im-pregnant-now-what
How do I tell my parents that I’m pregnant?,"Even though it might feel scary, talking with a parent or caregiver can really help. They can talk through your options with you, and help you get the health care you need.

Many people worry that their parents/caregivers will freak out, but that’s not always what happens. If you can, try to be open and honest. Start by saying that you trust them and need their help and support. Most of the time, they just want to make sure you’re healthy and safe. If your parents/caregivers do get upset, they may just need some time to calm down.

Sometimes parents/caregivers are shocked or angry, and sometimes they're understanding. There’s really no way to know how yours will feel unless you talk with them about it. It might help to find a time when you can talk in private and there are no distractions. If you’re feeling really nervous or scared, you can always ask a friend or other family member to be there with you during the conversation. That way, you’ll have support no matter what happens.

If you really feel like you can’t talk to your  parents/caregivers, try talking to another adult who you trust (like an aunt or uncle, grandparent, older sibling, school nurse, or counselor).

Facts About Sex Education,"Sex education is high quality teaching and learning about a broad variety of topics related to sex and sexuality. It explores values and beliefs about those topics and helps people gain the skills that are needed to navigate relationships with self, partners, and community, and manage one’s own sexual health. Sex education may take place in schools, at home, in community settings, or online. 

Planned Parenthood believes that parents play a critical and central role in providing sex education.

Comprehensive sex education refers to K-12 programs that cover a broad range of topics related to:

Human development, including puberty, anatomy, sexual orientation, and gender identity
Relationships, including self, family, friendships, romantic relationships, and health care providers
Personal skills, including communication, boundary setting, negotiation, and decision-making
Sexual behavior, including the full spectrum of ways people choose to be, or not be, sexual beings
Sexual health, including sexually transmitted infections, birth control, pregnancy, and abortion
Society and culture, including media literacy, shame and stigma, and how power, identity, and oppression impact sexual wellness and reproductive freedom
There are several important resources that help with implementing sex education, including:

Does Sex Education Work?,"Sex education gives young people the knowledge and skills they need for a lifetime of good sexual health. They learn how to have healthy relationships, make informed decisions about sex, think critically about the world, be a good ally to those who are marginalized, and love themselves for who they are.

Research shows that sex education that’s culturally responsive and inclusive helps young people develop the social and emotional skills they need to become caring and empathetic adults. This type of sex education early and often leads to appreciation of sexual diversity, dating and intimate partner violence prevention, development of healthy relationships, prevention of child sex abuse, improved social/emotional learning, and increased media literacy. It also helps young people avoid unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

Parents support sex education covering a wide range of topics in age-appropriate ways from elementary through high school, including self-esteem, healthy relationships and peer pressure, how to stay safe online including how to deal with pornography, anti-bullying, and consent and setting boundaries. The vast majority of parents support teaching topics like STIs, birth control, sexual orientation and gender identity, and pregnancy options including abortion in high school.

The sex education someone receives can come down to what school district they live in or which school they attend.

Planned Parenthood advocates for federal funding that supports sex education, such as the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPPP)and the Division of Adolescent and School Health.

These topics range from basic information on how HIV and other STIs are transmitted — and how to prevent infections — to critical communication and decision-making skills.

A study published by the Guttmacher Institute found that adolescents were less likely to report receiving sex education on key topics in 2015–2019 than they were in 1995  Overall, in 2015–2019, only half of adolescents reported receiving sex education that met the minimum standard articulated in Healthy People 2030. Among teens reporting penis-in-vagina sex, fewer than half (43% of females and 47% of males) received this instruction before they had sex for the first time.

Suction abortion (also called vacuum aspiration) is the most common type of in-clinic abortion. It uses gentle suction to empty your uterus. It’s usually used until about 14-16 weeks after your last period.

Dilation and Evacuation (D&E) is another kind of in-clinic abortion procedure. It uses suction and medical tools to empty your uterus. You can get a D&E later in a pregnancy than aspiration abortion -- usually if it has been 16 weeks or longer since your last period.

When can I get an in-clinic abortion?,"How early you can get an abortion depends on where you go. In some places, you can get it as soon as you have a positive pregnancy test. Other doctors or nurses prefer to wait until 5-6 weeks after the first day of your last period.

How late you can get an abortion depends on the laws in your state and what doctor, abortion clinic, or Planned Parenthood health center you go to. It may be harder to find a health care provider who will do an abortion after the 12th week of pregnancy, so it’s best to try to have your abortion as soon as possible.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/in-clinic-abortion-procedures

You can take pain medication like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin). You can also put a heating pad or hot water bottle on your belly or have someone rub your back. If you’re not feeling well after a couple of days, call your doctor or nurse.

You may have a range of emotions after having an abortion. Studies show that most people feel relief, but sometimes people feel sad or regretful. Many people feel all these things together. However you feel is totally normal — everybody’s experience is different. But if your mood keeps you from doing the things you usually do each day, call your doctor or nurse for help. You can also call Exhale or All-Options for free, confidential, and non-judgmental emotional support after an abortion — no matter how you’re feeling.

How will my abortion affect my periods?,"Abortion starts a new menstrual cycle, so your period should go back to normal 4-8 weeks after your abortion. When your next period will come depends on the birth control method you use.

If you’re not on hormonal birth control, you should have a period by 8 weeks after your abortion. If you’re not using hormonal birth control and you don’t get your period 8 weeks after your abortion, call your doctor or health center.

Keep in mind that you can get pregnant very quickly after an abortion, even if your period isn't back to normal yet. So if you don’t want to get pregnant again, it’s a good idea to talk to your nurse or doctor about birth control.

You may have some bleeding right after your abortion that’s different than your period. You could have heavy bleeding with clots for a few days, or spotting for several weeks. You can use pads, tampons, or a menstrual cup —  whatever's the most comfortable for you. But your nurse or doctor may recommend you use pads so you can track how much you're bleeding.

You can start using birth control immediately after having an abortion.

Some doctors, abortion clinics, and Planned Parenthood health centers can put an IUD in your uterus right after your abortion, during the same procedure. This is really convenient because you’ll get super effective birth control without having to go to a separate appointment.

Serious problems are really rare, but like all medical procedures, there can be some risks.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/in-clinic-abortion-procedures/how-safe-is-an-in-clinic-abortion
What are the possible risks of having an abortion?,"In-clinic abortion is very common, and it’s one of the safest medical procedures you can get. Abortions are similar, in terms of level of risk, to other gynecological procedures that take place in doctor’s offices every day.

But like any medical procedure, there are some risks. The chances of problems gets higher the later you get the abortion, and if you have sedation or general anesthesia.

Serious complications are really rare, but can happen. These include:

the abortion doesn’t work and the pregnancy doesn’t end

some of the pregnancy tissue is left in your uterus

blood clots in your uterus

very heavy bleeding

infection

injury to your cervix, uterus or other organs

allergic reaction to medication

These problems are really rare, and they’re usually easy to treat. If your abortion doesn’t end your pregnancy or get all the pregnancy tissue out, you may need another procedure — but this isn’t common.

In extremely rare cases, some complications can be very serious or even life-threatening. Call your doctor right away if you have:

heavy bleeding from your vagina that soaks through more than 2 maxi pads in an hour, for 2 or more hours in a row

severe pain or discomfort in your belly that medication doesn’t help

a fever of 100.4 or higher

If you have bad smelling discharge from your vagina or signs that you are still pregnant, call and make an appointment. If you have any questions or concerns, you can always call the 24/7 number that you get when you have your abortion.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/in-clinic-abortion-procedures/how-safe-is-an-in-clinic-abortion
Does abortion have long-term side effects?,"In-clinic abortion procedures are common and effective, and millions of people have gotten these abortions safely.

Unless there’s a rare and serious complication that’s not treated, there’s no risk to your future pregnancies or to your overall health. Having an abortion doesn’t increase your risk for breast cancer or affect your fertility. It doesn’t cause problems for future pregnancies like birth defects, premature birth or low birth weight, ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, or infant death.

Serious, long-term emotional problems after an abortion are rare, and about as uncommon as they are after giving birth. They are more likely to happen in people who have to end a pregnancy because of health reasons, people who don't have support around their decision to have an abortion, or people who have a history of mental health problems.

Where can I get an in-clinic abortion?,"You can get an in-clinic abortion at many Planned Parenthood health centers. Our caring doctors and nurses are experts at providing safe abortion and providing support throughout the process. You can also get an abortion from some private doctors or gynecologists, family planning clinics, and abortion clinics. Even if your local Planned Parenthood health center doesn't provide abortion services, you can call for more information about where to get an abortion. You can also visit AbortionFinder.org.

Depending on where you live, there may be restrictions if you’re 17 years old or younger, or waiting periods to get an abortion. You can ask about these when you call to make your appointment. All abortions are very safe, but it may be harder to find a health care provider who will do an abortion after the 12th week of pregnancy, so it’s best to try to have your abortion as soon as possible.

Some states have banned abortion or created lots of restrictions, which means it’s hard or illegal to get care in those states. But abortion is still legal in many states, and it’s legal to travel to another state to get an abortion. You can learn more about the laws in your state at AbortionFinder.org.

When you’re looking for a place to get an abortion, beware of “crisis pregnancy centers.” These are places that seem like normal medical centers, but they don't provide abortion or a full range of health care — they're actually run by people who want to scare or shame people out of getting an abortion. They often give you false or misleading information about pregnancy, abortion, and birth control, and they usually don't have to follow privacy laws.

How much does an abortion cost?,"An in-clinic abortion can cost up to around $800 in the first trimester, but it’s often less. The average cost of a first trimester in-clinic abortion at Planned Parenthood is about $600. The cost of a second trimester abortion at Planned Parenthood varies depending on how many weeks pregnant you are. The average ranges from about $715 earlier in the second trimester to $1,500-2,000 later in the second trimester. 

The cost of abortion can vary depending on the state or health center where you get care and whether you can use health insurance (private or government insurance). Your nearest Planned Parenthood health center can give you more information about the cost and funds that might be available to help you pay for your abortion.

Some things to know:

The professionals at Planned Parenthood will work to get you the services you need, whether or not you have insurance. Contact your nearest health center for more information on costs and whether financial and logistical assistance may be available.
Your abortion may be free or low-cost with health insurance. Some insurance plans don’t cover abortions. You can call your insurance provider directly to find out their policies.

Am I Pregnant?,"The only way to know for sure if you’re pregnant is to take a pregnancy test. 

Signs of pregnancy — like a missed period — can give you a “hint” that you MAY be pregnant, but it doesn’t mean you are. Many other things can also feel similar to pregnancy symptoms, like PMS.

It can be super stressful not knowing, and it’s totally normal to want an answer as soon as possible. Lots of people end up frantically searching the internet, trying to figure out whether they’re pregnant based on what they read online. But the reality is that Dr. Google can’t tell you if you’re pregnant — only a pregnancy test can.

You can use a regular pregnancy test that you can buy at most drugstores, superstores, dollar stores, and grocery stores. They’re very accurate as long as you take them after you miss a period. It doesn’t matter what brand you get or how much it costs — they all work the same way. Store-bought pregnancy tests are just as accurate as a urine pregnancy test that you’d get at a doctor’s office.

You can also get a pregnancy test from your nearest Planned Parenthood health center. 

If your pregnancy test is positive, it’s important to see a nurse or doctor right away to learn about your options and make sure you stay healthy — no matter what you decide to do about your pregnancy.

But be careful: There are places called “crisis pregnancy centers” or “pregnancy resource centers” that advertise free pregnancy tests and counseling. They may seem like normal medical clinics, but they aren't. They usually don’t even have real doctors or nurses working there. These places are run by people who want to scare or shame you out of getting an abortion or using birth control, and they often give misleading or wrong information about pregnancy and sexual health.

Something else to keep in mind: you can only get pregnant if semen (cum) gets on your vulva or in your vagina. So if you haven’t had vaginal sex or gotten any semen inside your vagina since your last period, you can’t be pregnant.

You can always count on Planned Parenthood to give you the real facts, without shame or judgment. If you have more questions, contact your nearest Planned Parenthood health center. You can also talk with a live health educator on our Chat/Text line — it’s totally free and confidential.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/blog/am-i-pregnant
What is the birth control shot?,"The depo shot (AKA Depo-Provera) is an injection you get once every 3 months. It’s a safe, convenient, and private birth control method that works really well if you always get it on time.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-shot
How does the birth control shot work?,"The birth control shot (sometimes called Depo-Provera, the Depo shot, or DMPA) contains the hormone progestin.  Progestin stops you from getting pregnant by preventing ovulation.  When there’s no egg in the tube, pregnancy can’t happen. It also works by making cervical mucus thicker. When the mucus on the cervix is thicker, the sperm can’t get through. And when the sperm and the egg can’t get together, pregnancy can’t happen.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-shot
Does the shot protect against STDs?,"No. The shot is really good at preventing pregnancy, but it won’t protect you from sexually transmitted infections.

Luckily, using condoms every time you have sex really lowers the chance of getting or spreading STDs. The other great thing about condoms is that they also protect against pregnancy, which means that using condoms along with the shot gives you awesome pregnancy-preventing power!
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-shot
How do I make the shot work best for me?,"To get the shot’s full birth control powers, you have to remember to get a new shot every 12-13 weeks. That’s about every 3 months, or 4 times a year. Most of the time, a doctor or a nurse must give you the shot. So you have to make an appointment at a health center, and then remember to go to the appointment. But you also may be able to get a supply of shots at the health center to bring home and give yourself.  You can use our birth control app to keep track of when you need to get your next shot, and any upcoming shot appointments. 

You can start using the birth control shot whenever you want. If you get your first shot within the first 7 days after the start of your period, you’re protected from pregnancy right away. If you get it at any other time in your cycle, you need to use another form of birth control (like a condom) for the first week after getting the shot.

After your first shot, it’s all about remembering when to get your follow-up shots. Here are some tips to make sure you stay on top of it:

Use our birth control reminder app or set an alarm on your phone.
Add it to whatever calendar you use on a daily basis.
Ask friends, family members, or your partner to remind you.
Bottom line: do whatever works for you to make sure you get your follow-up shots about every 12-13 weeks.

If you’re 2 or more weeks late getting your shot, your doctor or nurse may ask you to take a pregnancy test, or tell you to use emergency contraception if you had vaginal sex in the previous 120 hours (five days).

Want to be extra, super sure you don’t accidentally get pregnant? Also use a condom every time you have vaginal sex. Condoms are the only way to help protect yourself from STDs, so using the shot with condoms is the way to go.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-shot
"What does the depo shot do?
","Once a doctor or nurse gives you the depo shot, it releases a hormone called progestin into your body. Progestin stops you from getting pregnant by preventing ovulation. It also works by making your cervical mucus thicker. When your cervical mucus is thicker, the sperm can’t get through. And when the sperm and the egg can’t get together, pregnancy can’t happen.  

The shot is really good at preventing pregnancy, but it won’t protect you from STDs. Use a condom with the shot to help prevent pregnancy and STDs.

How effective is the birth control shot?,"When used perfectly, the birth control shot effectiveness is more than 99%, meaning less than 1 out of every 100 people who use it will get pregnant each year. But when it comes to real life, the shot is about 96% effective, because sometimes people forget to get their shots on time. So, in reality, about 4 out of every 100 shot users will get pregnant each year.

The better you are about getting your shot on time, the better it will work. But there’s a very small chance that you could still get pregnant, even if you always get the shot on time.

If effectiveness is the most important thing to you when picking what birth control to use, you might want to check out IUDs and the implant. They’re the most effective kinds of birth control. But if you decide the shot is right for you, make sure you always get your follow-up shots on time.

What if I’m late getting my birth control shot?,"If you get your shot late, you may not be protected from pregnancy — but it depends on how late you are. You can get your follow-up shots as early as 10 weeks after your last shot, or as late as 15 weeks after your last shot.  But, if you get your shot more than 15 weeks after your last shot, you’ll need to use another method of birth control, like a condom, for the first week after getting your shot.

If you have vaginal sex without using a condom more than 15 weeks after your last shot, you should use emergency contraception. You may also need to take a pregnancy test before getting your next shot.  The best way to prevent pregnancy while using the shot? Make sure you always get your shot on time, every time.

What birth control shot side effects should I expect?,"The hormones in the birth control shot may cause side effects in some people, but this doesn’t happen to everyone — many people use the shot with no problems at all. 

The most common depo shot side effects are changes in your periods, especially during the first year. These include: 

Bleeding more days than usual

Spotting (light bleeding or brown discharge between periods)

Not getting your period at all

About half of people stop getting their period while they’re on the shot (don’t worry, this is totally safe).

Other possible side effects include:

Nausea

Weight gain

Headaches

Sore breasts

Depression

Slight bruising where you got the shot

A small, permanent dent in the skin where you got the shot (this is very rare)

Negative Depo shot effects usually go away after 2-3 months, once your body gets used to the hormones in the shot. 

If you don’t like the way the shot makes you feel, talk with a nurse or doctor, like the ones at your local Planned Parenthood health center. They may suggest a different birth control method. Many people try a few different types of birth control before finding the right one for them. Keep in mind that if you stop getting your shots and don’t use another birth control method, it’s possible for you to get pregnant right away.

The hormones in the shot and other types of birth control have been around for decades, and millions of people have used them safely. Depo side effects aren’t dangerous (though there are some possible risks with using the shot, like with any medicine). You can always call a nurse or doctor, like the ones at your local Planned Parenthood health center, if you have any concerns.

Are there good Depo shot effects?,"Side effects aren’t always a bad thing — many people use the shot because some of the side effects can be really helpful. The hormones in the shot can help with painful or heavy periods. The shot may ease cramps and PMS, and it will usually make your period lighter. Many people on the shot stop getting their period at all while they’re using it. 

It’s totally safe to not get your period while you’re on the shot. The changes in your periods can sometimes make people worry about being pregnant. But the chance of pregnancy is very low as long as you always get your shot on time, every 3 months. If you’re worried, you can always take a pregnancy test to be sure.

The shot can also help protect you from certain health conditions, like cancer of the uterus and iron deficiency (anemia).
",
Will I have side effects when I stop using the shot?,"Any time there’s a change in your hormones — like when you go on or off hormonal birth control such as the shot — there’s a chance of temporary side effects. But they usually go away after a few months. 

After you stop using the shot, any Depo side effects that you had will eventually go away, and your body will return to the way it was before you started using it. So if the shot made your period stop, it will eventually come back after you go off the shot. It can take several months for your period to go back to your regular cycle, but you may still be able to get pregnant during this time.

The shot can delay both your period and your ability to get pregnant by up to 10 months after your last shot wears off. But some people do get pregnant soon after stopping the shot. There’s no way to know how long it will take for you. So if you stop using the shot but don’t want to get pregnant, make sure to use another method of birth control — even if your periods haven’t gone back to normal yet.

Everyone’s body is different, and our bodies also change over time. So you can’t predict exactly how your body will react to going off the shot. But any negative side effects that you may have will go away within a few months as your body gets used to being off the hormones.

If you’re worried about the side effects of going off the shot, talk with your nurse or doctor. They may be able to give you more specific information about what to expect based on your personal medical history.

"Does the birth control shot make you gain weight?
","The Depo shot causes weight gain in some people while they’re using it. Some people gain a lot of weight on the shot. But birth control shot weight gain doesn’t happen to everyone, and many people use the shot without gaining weight.

Everyone’s body is different, so birth control affects everyone a little differently. But birth control shouldn’t cause problems in your everyday life — it’s there to help you. So if depo makes you gain weight and this bothers you, or if you notice other side effects that you don’t like, talk with a nurse or doctor (like the ones at your closest Planned Parenthood health center). They may be able to help you find another type of birth control that works better for you. The pill, patch, ring, and IUD are methods that won’t affect your weight. Many people try a few different methods before finding one that works well for them. 

Once you stop getting the shot, any side effects you had will fade. So if the shot causes you to gain weight, that should stop shortly after you stop using it.

These complications aren’t common, but they can be serious. Your doctor or nurse can help you figure out what the risks are for you.

People who use the birth control shot may have temporary bone thinning. It increases the longer they use the shot.  Bone density usually comes back after they stop using the birth control shot except for people who have already reached menopause. To protect your bones, stop smoking, limit your alcohol, and get regular exercise and extra calcium.

There’s a very small chance that you can get pregnant even if you always use the shot correctly. The shot will not increase the risk of birth defects.

Most people using the birth control shot won’t have any problems at all. But just in case, it’s good to know what the signs of a serious issue are.

Tell your doctor or nurse if you have any of the following while using the shot:

severe depression
migraine with aura — bad headache where you see bright, flashing zigzags, usually before a bad headache
pus, pain for many days, or bleeding where you got the shot
very heavy bleeding from your vagina or bleeding for a lot more days than usual

You can start using the birth control shot whenever you want. If you get your first birth control shot within the first 7 days after the start of your period, you’re protected from pregnancy right away. If you get the shot within 7 days after a miscarriage or an abortion, you’re also protected from pregnancy right away. If you get the shot within 3 weeks of having a baby (giving birth), you’re also protected right away.

For all other times, use another form of birth control (like condoms) for the first week after getting the shot for the first time. As long as you get your shots on time, you won’t need a backup method of birth control after that first week. But remember that it’s still important to use condoms to protect yourself from STDs.

How long the depo shot stays in your system or lasts after you stop using it is a little bit different for everyone. It can take months for it to wear off. The length of time you use the shot for has no effect on how long the hormones in your shot take to leave your system. 

You can begin using a new hormonal birth control method immediately after you stop using the shot. And if you want to keep preventing pregnancy, it’s a good idea to get on a new method quickly. If you decide that you want to get pregnant right away after you stop getting the shot, you should know the shot may delay your ability to get pregnant by up to 10 months. However, some people do get pregnant soon after stopping the shot.

How long does it take for the shot to work?,"If you get your first birth control shot within the first 7 days after the start of your period, you’re protected from pregnancy right away. If not, it takes a full week for the shot to become effective. It’s a good idea to wait to have sex or use a backup method like condoms for that first week. If you get your following shots on time (every 12-13 weeks), they’ll start working right away. 

If you get your shot more than 15 weeks after getting your last shot, wait to have sex or use a backup method like condoms for the first week to help prevent pregnancy. Condoms also help prevent the spread of STDs.

What if I forget to get my shots on time?,"It depends on how late you are. You can get your follow-up shots as early as 10 weeks after your last shot, or as late as 15 weeks after your last shot.  But, if you get your shot more than 15 weeks after your last shot, you’ll need to use backup birth control, like a condom, for the first week after getting your shot.

If you had vaginal sex without using a condom more than 15 weeks after your last shot, you should think about using emergency contraception. You may also need to take a pregnancy test before getting your next shot.  The best way to prevent pregnancy while using the shot is to be super careful that you get your follow-up shots on time.

What are the benefits of the birth control shot?,"The birth control shot is effective at preventing pregnancy.
If you remember to get your shots on time, the shot (Depo-Provera) is a very effective birth control method.

Want maximum protection from pregnancy? Use condoms along with the shot. Bonus: condoms also protect you from STDs.

The shot is convenient and private.
The birth control shot (Depo-Provera) is easy to get. And once you have it, it’s super convenient. If you use it correctly, you only have to think about birth control 4 times each year. It’s great for people who don’t want to deal with taking a pill every day, or who don’t want to use birth control that interrupts sex. You may even be able to get shots to bring home and give yourself, which makes it extra convenient. 

If you do get the shot in a doctor’s office, it's super private. You wouldn't have to deal with packaging or any other evidence of birth control, so nobody has to know that you’re using it.

The shot is birth control you don’t have to use during sex, so it won’t get in the way of the action. If you use the shot correctly, you’re protected from pregnancy all day, every day. Many people say the shot makes their sex lives better because they don’t have to interrupt sex or worry about pregnancy.

The shot can make you get your period less often while you use it.
Lots of people like the shot because it makes their periods get lighter. Half of people who use the shot stop getting their periods. That usually happens after about a year of using the shot. Not getting your period is totally safe, so there’s nothing to worry about. However, for the first 12 months, many people say they bleed more days than usual and have spotting between periods. Your period should go back to normal a few months after you stop using the shot.

The birth control shot has health benefits.
The shot can help protect you from cancer of the uterus and ectopic pregnancy.  

The shot is temporary, so you can get pregnant after you stop using it if you want to.
Lots of people who use the birth control shot want to have kids when the time is right. One of the great things about the shot is that it’s not permanent. So you can get pregnant after you stop using it if you want to.

While the shot doesn’t change your ability to get pregnant in the long run, it can cause a delay of about 9-10 months in being able to get pregnant after stopping it. So, if you think you will want to get pregnant within the next year or so, talk with your doctor or nurse about other birth control options.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-shot/what-are-the-benefits-of-the-birth-control-shot
What are the disadvantages of the birth control shot?,"You have to get an injection every 3 months.
You have to go to a doctor's office or health center every 3 months for your injection. Or you may be able to get a supply of shots at the health center to bring home and give yourself every 3 months. Either way, the shot only works if you get it on time, so it's important to stay on schedule. You can use our birth control app to keep track of your next shot day and set reminders for upcoming appointments.

If you live far from a health center, or if you just have a really busy life and think you won’t stay on top of getting your follow-up shots, some other birth control methods might be a better fit for you. IUDs and implants are methods that you don’t need to think about once you get them put in.

There can be negative side effects while you use the shot.
Like all medicines, there can be side effects with the shot. But lots of people adjust to the shot with no problems. Many negative side effects usually go away after 2-3 months, once your body gets used to the shot. You can use our birth control app to keep track of the side effects you may be having. 

Most people on the shot have some change in their periods, including bleeding more days than usual, spotting between periods, or no periods.  This is most common during the first year. Other possible side effects include nausea, weight gain, headaches, sore breasts, or depression. You may also get slight bruising where you got the shot, or rarely, a small, permanent dent.

Lots of people who use the shot stop getting their period altogether after about a year of using it. Like all the side effects of the shot, this goes away after you stop getting the shot. Your period should go back to normal within a few months after your last shot wears off.

Birth control shouldn’t make you feel bad. Luckily, there are many different types of birth control, so you’ve got options. If you keep having side effects that bother you, talk with your nurse or doctor about trying another birth control method.

It may take up to 10 months after stopping the birth control shot to get pregnant.
It only takes 15 weeks after your last shot for pregnancy protection to wear off. How soon you get pregnant after stopping the depo shot is different for everyone. For some people it can take up to 10 months for their ability to get pregnant to return to normal and for others it can happen much sooner.

Your first period after stopping the depo provera shot can take several months to return. It can also take time for your period to go back to the way it was before you started using the shot. Everyone’s body is different, and reacts to going off the shot differently, so there’s no way to know when you will get your period back after your last depo shot. It’s possible to get pregnant before your period returns, so use another method of birth control if you don’t want to get pregnant after stopping the depo shot.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-shot/what-are-the-disadvantages-of-the-birth-control-shot
What happens when you stop getting the depo shot?,"After you stop using the shot, your body will eventually go back to the way it was before you started using it. And any Depo side effects you may have had will fade.

It can take up to 10 months after your last shot wears off for your period to come back and for you to be able to get pregnant. But some people do get pregnant soon after stopping the shot — there’s no way to know how long it will take for you. So if you stop using the shot but don’t want to get pregnant, make sure to use another method of birth control — even if your periods haven’t gone back to normal yet.

Everyone’s body is different, and our bodies also change over time. So you can’t know exactly how yours will react to going off the shot. But eventually your body will get used to being off the hormones in the shot, and any changes that you may have experienced will go away.

If you’re worried about the side effects of going off the shot, talk with your nurse or doctor. They can help you feel prepared for the transition off of the shot.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-shot/what-are-the-disadvantages-of-the-birth-control-shot
What is the birth control ring?,"The birth control ring (AKA the vaginal ring, or the ring) is a safe and convenient birth control method that works really well if you always use it correctly. You wear a small, flexible ring inside your vagina, and it prevents pregnancy 24/7 by releasing hormones into your body. The ring has lots of other health benefits, too. There are 2 kinds of birth control rings: NuvaRing and Annovera.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-vaginal-ring-nuvaring
How Does NuvaRing Work?,"Each NuvaRing lasts for up to 5 weeks. You take your old NuvaRing out of your vagina and put in a new one about once a month, depending on the ring schedule you choose. You can also use NuvaRing to safely skip your period if you want to.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-vaginal-ring-nuvaring
How Does Annovera work?,"One Annovera ring lasts for 1 year (13 cycles). You put the Annovera ring in your vagina for 21 days (3 weeks), then take it out for 7 days — Annovera comes with a case to safely store it during your ring-free week. After 7 ring-free days, put Annovera back in your vagina.

",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-vaginal-ring-nuvaring
How does the birth control ring prevent pregnancy?,"The ring works by stopping sperm from joining with an egg (which is called fertilization).

Like most birth control pills, the ring contains the hormones estrogen and progestin. These are similar to the hormones our bodies make naturally. You wear the ring inside your vagina, and you absorb the hormones into your body though your vaginal lining.

The hormones in the ring stop ovulation. No ovulation means there’s no egg hanging around for sperm to fertilize, so pregnancy can’t happen.

The ring’s hormones also thicken the mucus on your cervix. This thicker cervical mucus blocks sperm so it can’t swim to an egg — kind of like a sticky security guard.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-vaginal-ring-nuvaring
How do I make the ring work best for me?,"To get the vaginal ring's full birth control powers, you have to use it correctly. Making a mistake — like forgetting to refill your prescription or not putting your ring in on time — is the main reason why people might get pregnant when they’re using the ring.

Here are some ways to help make sure you stay on schedule:

Use our birth control reminder app or set an alarm on your phone.

Use a calendar to mark the days you need to take out the ring, put in the ring, and get a new ring.

Be birth control buddies with friends or family members who also use the ring, and help each other remember.

Your partner can help remind you.

Bottom line: do whatever works for you to make sure you use the ring correctly and replace it on time, all the time.

It’s also important to take care of your birth control ring properly:

Keep your ring(s) in the same place so you don’t lose them.

Store NuvaRings at room temperature, and away from direct sunlight for up to 4 months (16 weeks). Keep any NuvaRings that you won’t use within 4 months in the refrigerator.

When you take Annovera out, wash the ring with mild soap and lukewarm water, pat it dry with a clean paper towel or cloth, and store it in the case. Keep Annovera away from children, pets, and extreme temperatures when it’s out of your body. Don’t put Annovera in the refrigerator.

When the ring is in your vagina, don’t use any vaginal products with oil or silicone in them — no oil or silicone-based suppositories, creams, gels, or lubricants. Water-based lubes are OK to use.

Don’t use the birth control gel Phexxi with any kind of birth control ring.

Want to be extra sure you don’t accidentally get pregnant? You can also use a condom every time you have vaginal sex. That way you’ll be protected against STDs, too.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-vaginal-ring-nuvaring
Does the ring protect against STDs?,"Nope. The birth control ring is really good at preventing pregnancy, but it won’t protect you from sexually transmitted infections.

Luckily, using condoms every time you have sex really lowers the chance of getting or spreading STDs. Condoms also protect against pregnancy — so using condoms and the ring together gives you awesome pregnancy-preventing power.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-vaginal-ring-nuvaring
How effective is the birth control ring?,"If you use it perfectly, the ring is 99% effective. But people aren’t perfect and it can be easy to make a mistake — so in reality the ring is about 93% effective. That means about 7 out of 100 ring users get pregnant each year.

The better you are about putting the ring in your vagina on schedule, the better it will work. But there’s a very small chance that you could still get pregnant, even if you always use the ring correctly.

If you want a method that’s even better at preventing pregnancy and more convenient, check out IUDs and the implant. They’re the best at preventing pregnancy and the easiest to use, since you don’t have to remember to do anything for it to work. But if you decide the ring is right for you, make sure you always stay on schedule so it works as well as possible. 
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-vaginal-ring-nuvaring
What makes the ring less effective?,"The main thing that makes the ring not work is not using it correctly.

That means you’re more likely to get pregnant if:

You don’t put your ring in on time every cycle. 

Your NuvaRing ring is out of your vagina for more than 2 days (48 hours) in a row during the weeks when your ring should be in your vagina.

Your Annovera ring is out of your vagina for more than 2 hours at a time, or at different times that add up to more than 2 hours total during the 21 days you’re supposed to have it in.

These medicines or supplements can also make NuvaRing and Annovera not work as well:

• The antibiotics Rifampin, Rifampicin, and Rifamate (other antibiotics don’t make the ring less effective)

• The antifungal Griseofulvin (other antifungals don’t make the ring less effective)

• Certain HIV medicines

• Certain anti-seizure medicines (these are sometimes also used to treat psychiatric disorders like bipolar disorder)

• The herb St. John’s Wort

If you take any of these while you’re on the ring, use condoms as a backup method. Switch to a different type of birth control if you’ll be taking them for a long time.

Your nurse or doctor can help you decide if there’s any reason the birth control ring won’t work well for you.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-vaginal-ring-nuvaring
How long does it take the birth control ring to work?,"If you start using the ring during the first 5 days of your period, it will start working right away and you won’t need backup birth control. For example, if you get your period Monday morning, you can start using the ring anytime until Saturday morning and be protected from pregnancy right away.

If you start using the ring at any other time in your menstrual cycle, it will take 7 days to protect you from pregnancy. Use another method of birth control — like a condom — if you have vaginal sex during your first week on the ring.

Starting the ring after using emergency contraception:

If you start using the birth control ring after taking any emergency contraception pill — like Plan B or ella — use a backup birth control method (like condoms) for 7 days.

If you recently took the ella emergency contraception pill, don’t start using your birth control ring until it’s been 6 days or more since you had unprotected sex.

If you took a levonorgestrel emergency contraception pill (like Plan B or other over-the-counter brands), you can start using the ring right away.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-vaginal-ring-nuvaring
What are the side effects of the birth control ring?,"The birth control ring may cause side effects for some people, but they usually go away after a few months. And some birth control ring side effects are positive.

What are some Annovera or NuvaRing side effects that could happen?
The hormones in NuvaRing and Annovera birth control rings may cause side effects in some people. But this doesn’t happen to everyone — many people use the ring with no problems. 

After starting the ring, some people may have: 

Headaches 

Nausea

Sore breasts

Changes in your periods (early, late, or stopping altogether while on the ring)

Spotting (light bleeding or brown discharge)

More vaginal wetness

The good news is that these side effects usually go away in 2-3 months. So if you just started using the ring and you have side effects that bother you, try to stick it out and give your body a chance to adjust to the hormones. 

Birth control shouldn’t make you feel sick or uncomfortable. If you still don’t like the way the ring makes you feel after a few months, talk with your nurse or doctor. They may suggest a different birth control method. Some people try a few different types of birth control before finding the right one for them. 

And remember: if you stop using the ring and don’t use another birth control method, you’ll be at risk for pregnancy right away.

The hormones in the ring and other types of birth control have been around for decades, and millions of people have used them safely. Birth control ring side effects aren’t dangerous (though there are some possible risks, like with any medicine). You can always call a nurse or doctor, like the staff at your local Planned Parenthood health center, if you have any concerns while using the ring. And you can keep track of any potential side effects with our birth control app.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-vaginal-ring-nuvaring
Are any birth control ring side effects positive?,"Side effects aren’t always a bad thing — many people use the ring because some of the side effects can be really helpful. For example, the hormones in the ring can help with painful, heavy, or irregular periods. The ring may ease cramps and PMS, and it will usually make your period lighter and more regular. You can even use NuvaRing to safely skip your period. 

The changes in your periods while on the ring can sometimes make people worry about being pregnant. But the chance of pregnancy is very low as long as you’re using the ring correctly. If you’re worried, you can always take a pregnancy test to be sure.

The birth control ring can also help prevent acne, iron deficiency (anemia), bone thinning, cysts in your breasts and ovaries, and certain cancers.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-vaginal-ring-nuvaring
"If I go off the birth control ring, what side effects could I have?","Any time there’s a change in your hormones — like when you go on or off hormonal birth control such as the ring — there’s a chance of temporary side effects. But they usually go away after a few months.

When you go off the ring, your body will eventually return to the way it was before you went on it. So if the ring made your periods lighter, your periods will probably get heavier once you stop using it. It can also take a few months for your period to go back to the cycle you had before you started using the ring. And if the ring helped clear up your skin, your acne may come back after you go off the ring.

But everyone’s body is different, and our bodies also change over time. For example: you’re less likely to have acne after puberty, so if you started using the ring in your teens but stop using it in your 20s, you may have naturally grown out of your acne by then. 

Another important thing to note: you can get pregnant right away once you stop using the ring (even if your periods aren’t regular). So if you’re going off the ring but you don’t want to get pregnant, make sure to use another birth control method.

There’s no way to know exactly how your body will react to going off the ring, but any negative side effects that you may have will go away within a few months as your body gets used to being off the hormones.

If you’re really worried about the side effects of going off the ring, talk with your nurse or doctor. They may be able to give you more specific information about what to expect based on your personal medical history.

Your doctor will help you figure out if the ring is safe for you.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-vaginal-ring-nuvaring/how-safe-nuvaring
Are Annovera and NuvaRing safe?,"There’s a good chance birth control rings will be totally safe for you — most people can use them with no problems. The hormones in the ring are the same ones in most birth control pills, and millions of people have used these hormones to safely prevent pregnancy for more than 50 years.

Who can’t use birth control rings?
Like all medicines, the ring isn’t for everyone.

Smoking and birth control rings don’t always mix. 

If you smoke 15 cigarettes a day or more, don’t use NuvaRing, Annovera, or any other kind of birth control that has the hormone estrogen. 
If you smoke fewer than 15 cigarettes a day or vape nicotine at all, talk with your nurse or doctor about whether the birth control ring is safe for you. 
Smoking while taking birth control with estrogen (like combination pills, the patch, or the ring), makes you more likely to have problems like a stroke or heart attack.

If you’re a regular smoker, you can safely use any other method without estrogen — like progestin-only pills, the birth control shot, the birth control implant, and IUDs.

Also avoid using the ring if you’ve had any of these health problems:

blood clots, an inherited blood-clotting disorder, or vein inflammation

breast cancer

heart attack, stroke, angina, or other serious heart problems

migraine headaches with aura (seeing flashing, zigzag lines)

uncontrolled high blood pressure

very bad diabetes or liver disease

Talk with your doctor or nurse about your health history.  They can help you decide if the ring is right for you.

NuvaRing and Annovera rings are latex-free, so they’re safe for people with latex allergies.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-vaginal-ring-nuvaring/how-safe-nuvaring
"What are the risks of NuvaRing and Annovera?
","Even though birth control rings are very safe, using a form of birth control that has estrogen can slightly increase your risk of certain health problems. This isn't common and complications are rare, but they can be serious. Annovera and NuvaRing risks include heart attack, stroke, blood clots, and liver tumors. In very rare cases, they can lead to death.

When you talk with your doctor about birth control, tell them about any medicines you’re taking and any health problems you’ve had.

There’s a very small chance that you can get pregnant even if you always use the ring correctly. But if you do get pregnant and accidentally use the ring during the early part of your pregnancy, it won’t increase the chances of birth defects.

It’s important to remember that the chance of having any of these problems while using the ring is really, really low for most people. In fact, pregnancy is more likely to cause serious health problems than birth control like the ring. Your doctor or nurse can help you figure out which birth control method will be safest for you.

sudden back/jaw pain along with nausea, sweating, or trouble breathing

chest pain or discomfort

achy soreness in your leg

trouble breathing

severe pain in your belly or stomach

sudden, very bad headache

headaches that are different, worse, or happen more often than usual

Is it safe to use birth control rings while breastfeeding?,"The estrogen in the ring may lower the amount and quality of your breast milk in the first 3 weeks of breastfeeding. If you’re nursing, wait at least 3 weeks after giving birth to start using the ring.

Your breast milk will contain traces of the ring's hormones, but it’s not likely that these hormones will have any effect on your baby. Talk with your nurse or doctor if you have any concerns about breastfeeding and birth control.
",
How do I put in and take out the vaginal ring?,"It’s easy to put in the ring:

Check the expiration date on the package. If the expiration date has already passed, don’t use that ring.  

Wash your hands with soap and water

Take the ring out of the wrapper or case
If you’re using Annovera, wash your ring with mild soap and lukewarm water, then pat it dry with a clean cloth towel or paper towel. Do this every time you put in your Annovera ring. 

Squeeze the sides of the ring together with your fingers and gently push it deep into your vagina.

Don’t worry about the exact placement of the ring in your vagina — if you can’t feel it when you’re walking around, it’s in correctly. If the ring feels uncomfortable, try pushing it in deeper or moving it around in your vagina with your finger. The ring can't get lost in your vagina or be in too deep. You can leave your ring in during sex or any other kind of physical activity.
When it’s time to take your ring out, just hook your finger through the ring and gently pull it out of your vagina. 

If you’re using Annovera, wash your ring with mild soap and lukewarm water, pat it dry with a clean cloth towel or paper towel, and store it in its case at room temperature, away from kids and pets.

Once you’re done with your ring, put it in its case or foil wrapper and throw it in the trash. You can also wrap it in toilet paper, but using the case or foil wrapper is better for the environment because it helps keep any hormones that are left in the ring from getting into the soil and water. Don’t flush the ring down the toilet.

How do I use Annovera? ,"One Annovera ring has enough hormones in it to last for 13 cycles (1 year).

Using Annovera is simple: keep the ring in your vagina for 3 weeks (21 days), and then take it out for 1 week (7 days) — this ring-free week is usually when you’ll get your period. After 7 ring-free days, put your Annovera ring back in your vagina for the next 21 days.

Take out your ring and put it back in on the same day of the week every time. For example, if you put your ring in on a Sunday, take it out 3 weeks later on a Sunday. Then put it back in 7 days later on the following Sunday. So your “insertion day” and “removal day” will always be a Sunday.

It’s okay if you’re still bleeding or spotting when it’s time to put your ring back in — that’s normal. You can safely use tampons, menstrual cups, and pads with your Annovera ring in. Just be careful not to pull the ring out when you remove a tampon or menstrual cup.

Wash your Annovera ring with mild soap and lukewarm water anytime you take it out of your vagina and before you put it back in. Annovera comes with a case you can keep it in whenever it’s not in your body. Store Annovera away from extreme temperatures, pets, and kids. Don’t keep your Annovera ring in the refrigerator.

How do I use NuvaRing?,"One NuvaRing has enough hormones in it to last for up to 5 weeks. You have a few different options for ring schedules, and you can choose to get a period or choose to skip it. All of these schedules work just as well to prevent pregnancy.

If you want to get your period:

Wear a ring for 3 weeks (21 days), 4 weeks (28 days), or 5 weeks (35 days). Then take it out for the next week (7 days) — that’s when you’ll get your period. After 7 ring-free days, put in a new ring.

Take out your old ring and put a new one in on the same day of the week every time. For example, if you put a new ring in on a Sunday, take it out 3, 4, or 5 weeks later on a Sunday. Then put a new ring in 7 days later on the following Sunday. So your “removal day” and “new ring day” will always be a Sunday.

It’s okay if you’re still bleeding or spotting when it's time to put in a new ring — that’s normal. You can safely use tampons, menstrual cups, and pads with your NuvaRing in (just be careful not to pull the ring out when you remove a tampon or menstrual cup).

If you want to skip your period:

Skipping your period with NuvaRing is safe and super easy. Just keep the ring in your vagina at all times, and swap it out for a new one every 3-5 weeks. You can do this 2 ways:

Pick a date and always change your ring on that date. So if you put your first ring in on the 15th of the month, you always change your ring on the 15th of every month. (It’s ok that some months are longer than others.)

Wear the ring for 3 weeks (21 days), 4 weeks (28 days), or 5 weeks (35 days). Then take out your old ring and put in a new ring. Change your ring on the same day of the week every time — so if you put your ring in on a Monday, change it every 3, 4, or 5 weeks on a Monday.

You may have some bleeding or spotting when you use the ring to skip your period — that’s totally normal. If you skip your period week every month, the spotting should go away after several months.

There’s nothing dangerous or harmful about using NuvaRing to skip your period. And it comes in really handy if you want a special occasion (like a vacation or a hot date) to be period-free.

When can I start using the birth control ring?,"You can start using the birth control ring as soon as you get it — any day of the week, and anytime during your menstrual cycle. But depending on when you start the ring, you may need to use backup birth control (like condoms) for the first 7 days.

If you put your first ring in within 5 days after your period starts, it will start working right away. For example, if you get your period Monday morning, you can start using the ring anytime until Saturday morning and be protected from pregnancy right away.

If you start using the ring at any other time in your cycle, it needs to be in your vagina for 7 days before it will start protecting you from pregnancy. Use another method of birth control — like a condom — if you have vaginal sex during your first week on the ring.

Starting the ring after taking emergency contraception:

If you took a levonorgestrel emergency contraception pill (like Plan B or other over-the-counter brands), you can start using the ring right away.

If you recently took the ella emergency contraception pill, don’t start using the ring until it’s been 6 days or more since you had unprotected sex.

If you start using the ring after taking any emergency contraception pill — like Plan B or ella — use a backup birth control method (like condoms) for 7 days.

Starting the ring after pregnancy:

You can get pregnant again shortly after being pregnant, so talk with your nurse or doctor about starting your birth control as soon as you can.  

You can start using the ring right after an abortion or miscarriage. In general, you can start using the ring 3 weeks after giving birth (but wait 3 weeks whether you're breastfeeding or not). Read more about breastfeeding and the ring.

Do I have to take the ring out during sex?,"Nope. In fact, it’s best to leave the ring in your vagina as much as possible. NuvaRing and Annovera are made to be worn all the time, including during sex. If it bothers you or your partner, try moving the ring around until it feels comfortable.

If you do take the ring out during sex, rinse it in lukewarm (not hot) water and put it back in when you’re done. Just make sure you remember to put it back in as soon as you can. 

If you leave an Annovera ring out of your vagina for more than 2 hours at a time, or at different times that add up to more than 2 hours total during the 21 days you’re supposed to have it in, you won’t be protected from pregnancy.

If you leave a NuvaRing out of your vagina for more than 2 days during the weeks you’re supposed to wear it, you won’t be protected from pregnancy.

If your ring has been out of your vagina for too long, use a backup birth control method (like condoms) until the ring has been in your vagina for 7 days in a row.

Don’t use lube that has oil or silicone in it while the ring is in your vagina. Water-based lubes are safe to use. Don’t use the birth control gel Phexxi with the birth control ring.

The Annovera ring comes with a small case you can keep it in when it’s not in your vagina. Store Annovera at room temperature and away from kids and pets. Don’t put Annovera in the refrigerator.

What do I do if I want to get pregnant?,"If you decide you want to get pregnant, just take your ring out and throw it away.

It’s possible to get pregnant right after you stop using the ring. It can take a few months for your period to go back to the cycle you had before you started using it. But it’s still possible to get pregnant during that time, even if your period isn’t regular or you haven’t gotten your period yet since you stopped using the ring.

Can I use the NuvaRing if I'm breastfeeding?,"You can use NuvaRing or Annovera if you’re breastfeeding. But wait at least 3 weeks after you give birth to start using the ring if you’re breastfeeding.

The estrogen in the ring may lower the amount and quality of breast milk in the first 3 weeks of breastfeeding. If you use the ring after that time, your breast milk will have a little bit of the ring’s hormones in it — but these hormones aren’t likely to have any effect on your baby.

"What do I do if I forget to change my birth control ring, or it's out for too long?
","If you’re using NuvaRing: 
Here’s a handy tool to help you figure out what to do if something goes wrong. If you’ve already had sex in the last 5 days since making a ring mistake, you may want to use emergency contraception.

If you’re using Annovera and you:

Leave the Annovera ring out of your vagina for more than 2 hours at one time

Leave the Annovera ring out of your vagina at different times that add up to more than 2 hours total during the 21 days you’re supposed to have it in

Don’t put the Annovera ring back in your vagina on time after your ring-free week

Wash the ring with soap and water and put it back in as soon as you can. Then use a backup birth control method (like condoms) until the ring has been back in your vagina for 7 days in a row. If you’ve already had sex in the last 5 days since making a ring mistake, you may want to use emergency contraception.

If you leave Annovera in your vagina for more than 21 days, that’s OK. Just take it out for 7 days as soon as you can and restart your normal schedule — after 7 ring-free days, put the ring back in for 21 days, and repeat. You don’t need backup birth control or emergency contraception.

"How much does the birth control ring cost?
","Prices vary depending on whether you have health insurance, or if you qualify for Medicaid or other programs that cover the cost of the birth control ring.

One NuvaRing lasts for up to 5 weeks, and can cost anywhere from $0-$200. One Annovera ring lasts for 1 year and can cost anywhere from $0-2200.

"What are the benefits of the birth control ring?
","The ring is an effective way to prevent pregnancy.
If you follow the instructions and use birth control rings the right way, they give you great protection against pregnancy.

Just put your ring in on time, every time. And make sure it’s in your vagina when it’s supposed to be. That’s all you have to do. You can use our birth control reminder app to keep you on schedule.

You can use condoms along with the ring to get extra protection from pregnancy. Bonus: condoms also help protect against STDs.

The ring is convenient.
Using the birth control ring is easy and convenient. It’s great for people who don’t want to deal with taking a pill every day, or who don’t want to use birth control that you have to think about right before you have sex.

Depending on how you use it, you only have to think about your ring once or twice a month, when you’re inserting and removing it. But always remembering to put a new ring in on time can be hard. Use our birth control reminder app to keep you on schedule.

The ring is birth control you don’t have to think about during sex. If you use the ring correctly, you’re protected from pregnancy all day, every day. Many people say the ring makes their sex lives better because they don’t have to worry about birth control or pregnancy during sex.

You need a prescription from a nurse or doctor to get the ring. But depending on where you live, you might be able to get a prescription online or through a telehealth visit.

If you use NuvaRing, you may be able to pick up several rings at once or have them mailed to you every month. And Annovera is extra convenient because 1 ring lasts for 1 year — that means you only need to worry about getting your birth control once a year.

The ring can make your periods better.
Lots of people like the birth control ring because it makes their periods regular and easy to predict. The hormones in the ring can also help with menstrual cramps and make your period lighter.

You can also use NuvaRing to safely skip your period, which is totally convenient for people who want a special occasion to be period-free, or just don’t want a visit from Aunt Flo every month.

The birth control ring has health benefits.
Side effects aren’t always a bad thing, and the ring isn’t just for birth control. The ring has many perks besides pregnancy prevention.

The ring can help prevent or lessen:

acne

bone thinning

cysts in your breasts and ovaries

ectopic pregnancy

endometrial and ovarian cancers

serious infections in your ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus

iron deficiency (anemia)

PMS (premenstrual syndrome) 

You can keep track of any potential side effects with our birth control app.

You can get pregnant right away when you stop using the ring.
Many people who use birth control want to have kids when the time is right. One of the great things about the birth control ring is you can get pregnant soon after you stop using it.

After you stop using the ring, it usually takes 1-2 months for your periods to return to the cycle you had before you started using it. Once in a while, people have irregular periods or no periods at all for a few months. This is more likely if your periods were irregular before you started using the ring.

Even if your period doesn’t come back right away, it’s still possible to get pregnant when you’re not using the ring. So if you’re going off the ring but don’t want to get pregnant, start using another birth control method right away.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-vaginal-ring-nuvaring/how-do-i-use-nuvaring
What are the disadvantages of the birth control ring?,"You have to stay on schedule.
It’s really important to always put your ring in on time, or you might not be protected from pregnancy. Using our birth control app, setting a reminder, or marking your calendar can help you stay on schedule.

If you have a really busy life and think you won’t stay on top of your ring schedule, check out other birth control methods like IUDs or the implant that are super low-maintenance and almost impossible to mess up. Explore different birth control methods to find the method that’s best for you.

There can be negative side effects.
Like with all medicines, the birth control ring can have some side effects. But most usually go away after 2 or 3 months. Many people use the ring with no problems at all. You can keep track of any side effects with our app.

The most common side effects are spotting or bleeding between periods, sore breasts, nausea, or headaches. But these usually go away after 2 or 3 months, and they don’t happen to everyone who uses the ring. You may also have a little extra vaginal wetness when using the ring. 

Birth control shouldn’t make you feel sick or uncomfortable. Luckily, there are many different types of birth control, so you’ve got options. If you keep having side effects that bother you after using the ring for 3 months, talk with your nurse or doctor about trying another birth control method. But don’t stop using the ring without starting a new method if you can, or you won’t be protected from pregnancy.

There can be some rare but serious risks.
Serious problems from using the ring are very rare. People using birth control that has estrogen, like the birth control ring, have a slightly higher chance of having a few rare but dangerous problems than people who don’t use birth control with hormones. Read more about birth control ring safety.

For more information about side effects and risks, talk with your nurse or doctor or read the package insert that came with your birth control ring.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-vaginal-ring-nuvaring/how-do-i-use-nuvaring
"What is the birth control patch?
","The transdermal contraceptive patch is a safe and convenient birth control method that works really well if you always use it correctly. You wear the patch on certain parts of your body, and it releases hormones through your skin that prevent pregnancy. The patch has lots of other health benefits, too.

There are two brands of birth control patches available in the U.S.: the Xulane patch and the Twirla patch.

",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-patch
How does the birth control patch work?,"The birth control patch prevents pregnancy by stopping sperm from joining with an egg (which is called fertilization). 

Like most birth control pills, the patch has the hormones estrogen and progestin — these are similar to the hormones our bodies make naturally. The hormones in the patch stop ovulation. No ovulation means there’s no egg hanging around for sperm to fertilize, so pregnancy can’t happen. The patch’s hormones also thicken the mucus on your cervix. This thicker cervical mucus blocks sperm so it can’t swim to an egg — kind of like a sticky security guard.

You wear the Xulane or Twirla patch on your belly, butt, or back. You can also wear the Xulane patch on the outer part of your upper arm. The hormones in the patch go into your body through your skin.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-patch
How do I make the patch work best for me?,"To get the patch’s full birth control powers, you have to use it correctly. Making a mistake — like forgetting to refill your prescription or not putting on a new patch on time — is the main reason why people might get pregnant when they’re using the patch.

Here are some tips to help you stay on schedule:

Note your patch change days on your calendar.

Be patch buddies with friends or family members who also use the patch, and help each other remember.

Your partner can help remind you.

It’s also important to store and use your patch correctly:

Keep your replacement patches in the same place so you don’t lose them.

Store your patches at room temperature, and away from direct sunlight. Don’t store them in the refrigerator or freezer. Keep each patch sealed in its pouch until right before you put it on.

Check your patch once a day to make sure it’s still sticking to your skin correctly.

Don’t put your patch in a place where it can be rubbed by tight clothes (like the waistband of your pants or underwear).

Make sure the skin where you’re going to put the patch is clean and dry. Don’t use lotion, oils, creams, powder, or makeup on your patch area.

Bottom line: do whatever works for you to make sure you use your patch correctly all the time.

Want to be extra super-duper sure you don’t accidentally get pregnant? You can use a condom with the patch every time you have penis-in-vagina sex. That way you’ll be protected from STDs, too.

",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-patch
Does the patch protect against STDs?,"Nope. The patch is really good at preventing pregnancy, but it won’t protect you from sexually transmitted infections.

Using condoms every time you have sex really lowers your chances of getting or spreading STDs. Condoms also protect against pregnancy — so using condoms and the patch together gives you awesome pregnancy-preventing power.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-patch
How effective is the birth control patch?,"If you use it perfectly, the patch is 99% effective. But people aren’t perfect, and it can be easy to make a mistake — so in reality, the patch is about 93% effective. That means about 7 out of 100 patch users get pregnant each year.

The better you are about using your patch correctly, the better it will work. Your chances of getting pregnant on the patch depend on how well you follow the directions for using it. But there’s a very small chance that you could still get pregnant, even if you always use the patch perfectly.

Make sure you always stay on schedule with your patches. Only put the patch on clean, dry skin. And check your patch every day to make sure the edges are sticking to your skin. 

If the patch gets loose, you can put it back on as long as it’s sticky enough to stay all the way on your skin — if the patch won’t stick anymore, throw it away and put on a new patch.

Don’t try to put a patch back on if:

It isn’t sticky enough to stay all the way on.
It gets stuck to itself or something else.
It fell all the way off your skin.
Don’t use tape or other materials to stick a non-sticky patch back on your skin. If a patch doesn’t stick to your skin by itself, it won’t work — put on a new patch right away.

If it’s been more than 1 day (for Twirla), or 2 days (for Xulane) since your patch came loose, put on a new patch right away. 

Read more about what to do if your patch falls off.

If you often forget or misplace things, you may want to use another method that you don’t have to remember to change every week, like the IUD, implant, or shot. They’re easier to use and better at preventing pregnancy. But if you decide the patch is right for you, make sure you always put your new patch on on time so it works as well as possible. ",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-patch/how-effective-is-the-birth-control-patch
What makes the patch less effective?,"The main thing that makes the patch not work is not using it correctly. That means you’re more likely to get pregnant if you don’t put on a new patch every week on schedule, or if the patch falls off for more than 1 or 2 days, depending on which patch you’re using — 1 day (24 hours) for Twirla, and 2 days (48 hours) for Xulane.

Some medicines or supplements can also make the patch less effective:

• The antibiotics Rifampin, Rifampicin, and Rifamate (other antibiotics don’t make the patch less effective)

• The antifungal Griseofulvin (other antifungals don’t make the patch less effective)

• Certain HIV medicines

• Certain anti-seizure medicines (these are sometimes also used to treat psychiatric disorders like bipolar disorder)

• The herb St. John’s Wort

Use condoms as a backup method if you’re taking any of these medicines while you’re on the patch. Switch to a different type of birth control if you’ll be taking them for a long time.

The patch may not work quite as well to prevent pregnancy if you have a higher weight. Your nurse or doctor can help you decide if there’s any reason the patch won’t work well for you.

If you swim a lot or spend lots of time in water, it’s a good idea to check your patch often to make sure it's still sticking.

If you start using the patch at any other time in your menstrual cycle, it will take 7 days to protect you from pregnancy. Use another method of birth control — like a condom — if you have vaginal sex during your first week on the patch.

Starting the patch after using emergency contraception:

If you start using the birth control patch after taking any emergency contraception pill — like Plan B or ella — use a backup birth control method (like condoms) for 7 days.

If you recently took the ella emergency contraception pill, don’t start using the birth control patch until it’s been 6 days or more since you had unprotected sex.

After starting the patch, some people may have: 

Headaches 

Nausea

Sore breasts

Changes in your periods (early, late, or stopping altogether while on the patch)

Spotting (light bleeding or brown discharge)

Skin reactions where the patch goes (like itching, dryness, pain, swelling, or a rash)

The good news is that these side effects usually go away in 2-3 months. So if you just started using the patch and you have side effects that bother you, try to stick it out and give your body a chance to adjust to the hormones. 

Birth control shouldn’t make you feel sick or uncomfortable. If you still don’t like the way the patch makes you feel after a few months, talk with your nurse or doctor. They may suggest a different birth control method. Some people try a few different types of birth control before finding the right one for them. 

And remember: if you stop using the patch and don’t use another birth control method, you’ll be at risk for pregnancy right away.

The hormones in the patch and other types of birth control have been around for decades, and millions of people have used them safely. Side effects of the patch aren’t dangerous (though there are some possible risks, like with any medicine).

Does the birth control patch have good side effects?,"Side effects aren’t always a bad thing — many people use the patch because some of the side effects can be really helpful. For example, the hormones in the patch can help with painful, heavy, or irregular periods. The patch may ease cramps and PMS, and it will usually make your periods lighter and more regular. And you can use the Xulane patch to safely skip your period. 

The changes in your periods while on the patch can sometimes make people worry about being pregnant. But the chance of pregnancy is very low as long as you’re using the patch correctly. If you’re worried, you can always take a pregnancy test to be sure.

The birth control patch can also help prevent acne, iron deficiency (anemia), bone thinning, cysts in your breasts and ovaries, and certain cancers.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-patch/birth-control-patch-side-effects
What are potential side effects of going off the birth control patch?,"Any time there’s a change in your hormones — like when you go on or off hormonal birth control such as the patch — there’s a chance of temporary side effects. But they usually go away after a few months.

When you go off the patch, your body will eventually return to the way it was before you went on it. So if the patch made your periods lighter, your periods will probably get heavier once you stop using it. It can also take a few months for your period to go back to the cycle you had before you started using the patch. And if the patch helped clear up your skin, your acne may come back after you go off the patch. But everyone’s body is different, and our bodies also change over time. For example: you’re less likely to have acne after puberty, so if you started using the patch in your teens but stop using it in your 20s, you may have naturally grown out of your acne by then. 

Another important thing to note: you can get pregnant right away once you stop using the patch (even if your periods aren’t regular). So if you’re going off the patch but you don’t want to get pregnant, make sure to use another birth control method.

There’s no way to know exactly how your body will react to going off the patch, but any negative side effects that you may have will go away within a few months as your body gets used to being off the hormones.

If you’re really worried about the side effects of going off the patch, talk with your nurse or doctor. They may be able to give you more specific information about what to expect based on your personal medical history.

Does the patch make you gain weight?,"Nope! Birth control patch weight gain isn’t a common side effect.

There’s lots of research on the hormones in the birth control patch, and studies show these hormones don’t usually cause weight gain or weight loss. The same goes for the birth control pill and birth control ring — these methods of birth control use the same hormones, so they won’t cause you to gain or lose weight either. The hormonal IUD and the copper IUD also won’t lead to weight gain or loss.

There are 2 types of birth control that may cause weight gain in some people who use them: the birth control shot and the birth control implant. But this doesn’t happen to everybody who uses these types of birth control. Many people use the shot or the implant without gaining weight.

Everyone’s body is different, so birth control affects everyone a little differently. But birth control shouldn’t cause problems in your everyday life — it’s there to help you. So if you notice side effects that you don’t like, talk with a nurse or doctor (like the ones at your closest Planned Parenthood health center). They may be able to help you find another type of birth control that works better for you. Many people try a few different methods before finding one that works well for them.

If you smoke 15 cigarettes a day or more, don’t use the patch or any other kind of birth control that has the hormone estrogen (like the pill or ring). 
If you smoke fewer than 15 cigarettes a day or vape nicotine at all, talk with your nurse or doctor about whether the birth control patch is safe for you.
Smoking while taking birth control with estrogen (like combination pills, the patch, or the ring), makes you more likely to have problems like a stroke or heart attack.

If you’re a regular smoker, you can safely use any other method without estrogen — like progestin-only pills, the birth control shot, the birth control implant, and IUDs.

Also avoid using the patch if you’ve had or currently have:

migraine headaches with aura (seeing flashing, zigzag lines)

breast cancer

heart attack, stroke, angina, or other serious heart problems

very bad diabetes or liver disease

uncontrolled high blood pressure

blood clots, an inherited blood-clotting disorder, or vein inflammation

Talk with your doctor or nurse about your health history.  They can help you decide if the patch is right for you.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-patch/how-safe-birth-control-patch
What are the risks of the birth control patch?,"Even though the Twirla patch and Xulane patch are very safe, using a form of birth control that has estrogen can slightly increase your risk of certain health problems. These complications aren’t common, but they can be serious. They include heart attack, stroke, blood clots, and liver tumors. In very rare cases, they can lead to death.

When you talk with your nurse or doctor about birth control, tell them about any medicines you’re taking and any health problems you’ve had.

There’s a very small chance that you can get pregnant even if you always use the patch correctly. If you do get pregnant and accidentally use the patch during the early part of your pregnancy, it won’t increase the chances of birth defects.

It’s important to remember that the chance of having any of these problems while using the birth control patch is really, really low for most people. In fact, pregnancy is more likely to cause serious health problems than the patch. Your nurse or doctor can help you figure out which birth control method will be safest for you.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-patch/how-safe-birth-control-patch
What warning signs should I know about?,"Most people on the patch won’t have any problems at all. But just in case, it’s good to know what the signs of a serious issue are.

See a doctor or nurse right away if you have:

sudden back/jaw pain along with nausea, sweating, or trouble breathing

chest pain or discomfort

achy soreness in your leg

trouble breathing

severe pain in your belly or stomach

sudden, very bad headache

headaches that are different, worse, or happen more often than usual

aura — (seeing flashing, zigzag lines)

yellowing of your skin or eyes

You can always call a nurse or doctor, like the ones at your local Planned Parenthood health center if you have any questions or you’re worried about any health issues.

",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-patch/how-safe-birth-control-patch
Is it safe to use the patch while breastfeeding?,"You can use the patch while breastfeeding. But the estrogen in the patch may lower the amount and quality of your breast milk during the first 3 weeks of breastfeeding. So if you’re nursing, wait at least 3 weeks after giving birth to start using the patch.

Your breast milk will contain traces of the patch's hormones, but it’s unlikely that these hormones will have any effect on your baby. Talk with your nurse or doctor if you have concerns about breastfeeding and birth control.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-patch/how-safe-birth-control-patch
How do I use the birth control patch?,"It’s easy to use the Xulane patch or Twirla patch: just stick a new patch to clean, dry skin. You can put Xulane or Twirla on your belly, buttocks (butt cheeks), or back. You can also put Xulane on the outer part of your upper arm. Don’t put the patch on your breasts.

Always check the expiration date before putting on a new patch. 

If you’re using Xulane, open the foil pouch by tearing along the top and side, then peel the foil open until it’s flat. Take the patch and plastic layer off the foil. Peel one half of the clear plastic off the patch.

If you’re using Twirla, tear open the foil pouch and pull the patch out. Peel the bigger piece of the clear plastic off the patch. 

Hold the patch by the side that still has the other piece of clear plastic on it. Try not to touch the sticky part with your fingers. 

Put that sticky half of the patch on your belly, buttocks (butt cheeks), or back. Xulane can also go on your upper outer arm.

Pull off the other piece of the clear plastic and press the whole patch to your skin. 

Hold the patch in place against your skin with the palm of your hand for 10 seconds.

Once you open a pouch, put the patch on immediately. Pick a spot where it can lie flat and smooth, and won’t rub against the waistband or seams of your clothes. Don’t put your new patch on the exact same spot as your last patch. 

Always put the patch on clean, dry skin. Don’t use lotion, oils, creams, powder, or makeup on the skin where you put your patch — that can keep the patch from sticking.

The patch is made to stay in place while swimming, sweating, or in a jacuzzi, bathtub, shower, or sauna. But if you spend a lot of time doing these things, check your patch every day to make sure it’s sticking.

When you take your old patch off, fold it in half so it sticks together, seal it in a plastic bag, and throw it in the trash. Make sure kids or pets can’t get to it, and don’t flush it down the toilet. (You’ll be helping out the environment if you follow these directions because it helps keep any hormones that are left in the patch from getting into the soil and water.)",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-patch/how-do-i-use-birth-control-patch
How often do I need to put on a new patch?,"Change your patch once a week. Don’t put a new patch on the exact same spot on your skin as your last patch.

Wear a patch for 1 week (7 days), then take off that patch and put on a new one. Be sure to put on a new patch on the same day every week — this will be your “patch change day.” If you start on a Monday, then Mondays are always the day you take off your old patch and put on a new one.

1 patch only has enough hormones in it to last for 1 week (7 days). So don’t wear the same patch longer than a week. Change your patch once a week for 3 weeks straight.

On week 4, take off your old patch and don’t wear a patch at all during that 4th week — that’s when you’ll get your period. After 7 patch-free days, put on a new patch and start the cycle over.  Each pack has 3 weekly patches in it, so you’ll use 3 patches per month. 

It’s really important to put your new patch on right after your patch-free week, or you’ll be at risk for pregnancy. It’s okay if you’re still bleeding or spotting when it’s time to put on a new patch — that’s normal.

",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-patch/how-do-i-use-birth-control-patch
How do I skip my period with the Xulane patch?,"If you’re using Xulane, you can choose to skip a period whenever you want — or even stop having periods altogether while you’re on the patch. Skipping your period with the Xulane patch is just as effective at preventing pregnancy, and it’s safe and super easy.

Just start a new pack of patches on week 4, instead of having a patch-free week on week 4. So you’ll use 4 patches a month, instead of 3. Keep changing your patch on time every 7 days, and make sure you’re always wearing a patch. That’s it!

You may have some bleeding or spotting for the first 6 months when you use the patch to skip your period. It’s totally normal and should go away eventually.

There’s nothing dangerous or harmful about using the patch to stop or skip your period. And it comes in really handy if you want a special occasion (like a vacation or a hot date) to be period-free. If you stop using the patch, your period will go back to the way it was before you started using it.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-patch/how-do-i-use-birth-control-patch
When can I start using the patch?,"You can start using the birth control patch as soon as you get it — any day of the month, and anytime during your menstrual cycle. But depending on when you start the patch, you may need to use a backup birth control method (like condoms) for the first 7 days. 

If you start using the patch during the first 5 days of your period, it will start working right away and you won’t need backup birth control. For example, if you get your period Monday morning, you can start using the patch anytime until Saturday morning and be protected from pregnancy right away.

If you start using the patch at any other time in your menstrual cycle, it will take 7 days to protect you from pregnancy. Use another method of birth control — like a condom — if you have vaginal sex during your first week on the patch.

Starting the patch after taking emergency contraception:

If you took a levonorgestrel emergency contraception pill (like Plan B or other over-the-counter brands), you can start using the patch right away.

If you recently took the ella emergency contraception pill, don’t start using the patch until it’s been 6 days or more since you had unprotected sex.

If you start using the patch after taking any emergency contraception pill — like Plan B or ella — use a backup birth control method (like condoms) for 7 days.

Starting the patch after pregnancy:

You can get pregnant again shortly after being pregnant, so talk with your nurse or doctor about starting your birth control as soon as you can.  

You can start using the patch right after an abortion or miscarriage. In general, you can start using the patch 3 weeks after giving birth (but wait 3 weeks whether you're breastfeeding or not). Read more about breastfeeding and the patch.

How should I store my birth control patches?,"Store your patches at room temperature away from sunlight, and don’t refrigerate them or put them in the freezer. Keep your patches sealed in their pouches until you use them. Read the storage instructions on the package, and always check the expiration date before putting on a new patch. Once you open a pouch, put the patch on immediately.

"What do I do if I decide I want to get pregnant and have the patch?
","If you decide you want to get pregnant, just take off your patch and throw it away. 

It’s possible to get pregnant right after you stop using the patch. It can take a few months for your period to go back to the cycle you had before you started using it. But it’s still possible to get pregnant during that time, even if your period isn’t regular or you haven’t gotten your period yet since stopping the patch.

What do I do if my birth control patch keeps falling off?,"In order for the patch to work correctly, it must completely stick to your skin with smooth edges and no wrinkles. If your patch doesn’t stick to your skin easily, take it off and put on a new patch. 

Always put your patch on clean, dry skin, and keep creams, lotions, oils, powder, and makeup away from your patch area. Don’t put the patch where it might get rubbed by your clothes, like near your waistband — this can make it fall off. If you spend a lot of time in water, check your patch regularly to make sure it’s still sticking.

If your patch falls off or partially falls off for less than 1 day (Twirla) or less than 2 days (Xulane), try to put it back on. If the patch does not stick completely, put on a new patch immediately. Your “patch change day” will stay the same and you’re still protected from pregnancy.

If your patch falls completely or partially off for more than 1 day (Twirla) or more than 2 days (Xulane), or if you’re not sure how long your patch has been off, put on a new patch and start a new 4-week cycle. This will be your new “patch change day.” Use a backup birth control method — like condoms — for the next 7 days.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-patch/how-do-i-use-birth-control-patch
What's the best place on my body to put the birth control patch?,"It depends. You can put Xulane or Twirla on the sides of your belly, buttocks (butt cheeks), or back. You can also put Xulane on the upper part of your outer arm (but not Twirla).

It’s important to put it somewhere that won’t be rubbed by your clothes. The patch can fall off if it’s under your waistband, near your joints, on your breasts, or on cut or irritated skin. 

Don’t place your new patch in the same place as your last patch, and never use lotions, creams, oils, powders, or makeup where your patch is. This can cause your patch to fall off or become loose. 

Remember, the patch must be completely stuck onto your skin to work. So place every new patch on clean and dry skin, and make sure there are no lumps or raised edges.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-patch/how-do-i-use-birth-control-patch

Try to stick the patch back on in the same place right away. 

Don’t put it back on if it’s not sticky anymore, has other stuff stuck to it, or gets stuck to itself — use a new patch instead.

How much does the birth control patch cost?,"Prices vary depending on whether you have private health insurance, or if you qualify for Medicaid or other government programs that cover the cost of the patch.

One pack has 3 patches and lasts for 1 month (or 3 weeks, if you choose to use the patch to skip your period). One pack of patches can cost anywhere from $0-$150. But the patch is totally free with most health insurance plans, or if you qualify for some government programs that pay for birth control.

You may also need to pay for an appointment with a doctor or nurse to get a prescription for the patch. This visit can cost anywhere from $35–$250. But most insurance plans cover doctor’s visits that are related to birth control. Learn more about health insurance and birth control.

If you’re worried about cost, check with your local Planned Parenthood health center to find out if they can hook you up with birth control that fits your budget.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-patch/how-do-i-get-birth-control-patch
How can I get the patch for free?,"There’s a good chance you can get low-cost or free birth control patches if you have health insurance.

In some places, you can get a prescription through the Planned Parenthood Direct app or directly from a pharmacist.

During your visit, a nurse or doctor will talk with you about your medical history, check your blood pressure, and give you whatever exams you may need.

What are the benefits of the birth control patch?,"The patch is an effective way to prevent pregnancy (when used correctly).
If you follow the instructions and use the patch the right way, it gives you great protection against pregnancy.

Just change your patch on time every week. And make sure you’re wearing it when you’re supposed to. That’s all you have to do. You can use Spot On (our birth control reminder app) to help you stay on schedule.

You can use condoms along with the patch to get extra protection from pregnancy. Bonus: condoms also help protect against STDs.

The patch is convenient.
Using the patch is easy and convenient. It’s great for people who don’t want to deal with taking a pill every day, or who don’t want to use birth control that you have to think about right before you have sex.

You only have to think about your patch once a week, when you’re taking it off and putting another one on. But remembering to change your patch on time can be hard. Our birth control reminder app, Spot On, can help you stay on schedule. 

The patch is birth control you don’t have to think about during sex. If you use the patch correctly, you’re protected from pregnancy all day, every day. Many people say the patch makes their sex lives better because they can get caught up in the heat of the moment without worrying about birth control or pregnancy.

You need a prescription from a nurse or doctor to get the birth control patch. But you may be able to pick up several months’ worth of patches at once, or have them mailed to you. Depending on where you live, you may be able to order the birth control patch online.

The patch can make your periods better
Lots of people like the patch because it makes their periods regular and easy to predict. The hormones in the patch can also help with menstrual cramps and make your periods lighter.

You can also use the Xulane patch to safely skip your period, which is great for people who want a special occasion to be period-free, or just don’t want a visit from Aunt Flo every month.

The patch has health benefits.
Birth control patch side effects aren’t always a bad thing, and the patch isn’t just for birth control. The patch has many perks besides pregnancy prevention.

The patch can also help lessen or prevent:

acne

bone thinning

cysts in your breasts and ovaries

ectopic pregnancy

endometrial and ovarian cancers

serious infections in your ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus

iron deficiency (anemia)

PMS (premenstrual syndrome)

You can get pregnant right away when you stop using the patch.
Many people who use birth control do want to have kids when the time is right. One of the great things about the patch is you can get pregnant soon after you stop using it.

After you stop using the patch, it usually takes 1-2 months for your periods to return to the cycle you had before you started using it. Once in a while, people have irregular periods or no periods at all for up to 6 months. This is more likely if your periods were irregular before you started the patch.

Even if your period doesn’t come back right away, it’s still possible to get pregnant when you’re not using the patch. So if you’re going off the patch but don’t want to get pregnant, start using another birth control method right away.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-patch/what-are-benefits-birth-control-patch

It’s really important to always change your patch on time, or you might not be protected from pregnancy. Using Spot On (our birth control app), setting a reminder, or marking your calendar can help you stay on schedule.

If you have a really busy life and think you won’t stay on top of your patch schedule, check out other birth control methods like IUDs or the implant that are super low-maintenance and almost impossible to mess up.

Like all medicines, there can be birth control patch side effects. But they usually go away after 2 or 3 months. Many people use the patch with no problems at all. You can keep track of any side effects with our Spot On app.

The most common side effects are spotting or bleeding between periods, sore breasts, nausea, or headaches. But these usually go away after 2 or 3 months, and they don’t happen to everyone who uses the patch.

Birth control shouldn’t make you feel sick or uncomfortable. Luckily, there are many different types of birth control, so you’ve got options. If you keep having side effects that bother you, talk with your nurse or doctor about trying another birth control method. But don’t stop using the patch without starting a new method if you can, or you won’t be protected from pregnancy.

There can be some rare but serious risks.
Serious problems from using the birth control patch are very rare. People using birth control that has estrogen, like the patch, have a slightly higher chance of having a few rare but dangerous problems than people who don’t use birth control with hormones.

There are two kinds of birth control pills:

Combination pills (aka combined oral contraceptives, or COCs)

Combination pills have both estrogen and progestin

These are the most common type of birth control pill 

Progestin-only pills (aka POPs or mini pills)

Progestin-only pills only have progestin",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-pill
How do birth control pills prevent pregnancy?,"The birth control pill works by stopping sperm from joining with an egg. When sperm joins with an egg it’s called fertilization.

The hormones in the pill safely stop ovulation. No ovulation means there’s no egg for sperm to fertilize, so pregnancy can’t happen.

The pill’s hormones also thicken the mucus on the cervix. This thicker cervical mucus blocks sperm so it can’t swim to an egg — kind of like a sticky security guard.

Does the pill protect against STDs?,"Nope. The pill is really good at preventing pregnancy, but it won’t protect you from sexually transmitted infections.

How effective is the birth control pill?,"If you use it perfectly, the pill is 99% effective. But people aren’t perfect and it’s easy to forget or miss pills — so in reality the pill is about 93% effective. That means about 7 out of 100 pill users get pregnant each year.

The better you are about taking your pill every day and starting your pill packs on time, the better the pill will work. You can use our birth control app to remind you to take your pills when you need to. But there’s a very small chance that you could still get pregnant, even if you always take your pills correctly.

If you want a method that’s even better at preventing pregnancy, check out IUDs and the implant. They’re the best at preventing pregnancy.

These medicines or supplements can also make the pill not work as well:

• The antibiotic Rifampin (other antibiotics don’t make the pill less effective)

• The antifungal Griseofulvin (other antifungals don’t make the pill less effective)

• Certain HIV medicines

• Certain anti-seizure medicines (these are sometimes also used to treat psychiatric disorders like bipolar disorder)

• The herb St. John’s Wort

If you take any of these while you’re on the pill, use condoms as a backup method. Switch to a different method of birth control if you’ll be on them for a long time.

Combination Pills (COCs)

If you start combination pills within 5 days after the first day of your period, you’ll be protected from pregnancy right away. For example, if you get your period Monday morning, you can start the pill anytime until Saturday morning and be protected from pregnancy that same day.

If you start combination pills any other time, you need to take the pill for 7 days before you’ll be protected from pregnancy. So use another method of birth control — like a condom — if you have penis-in-vagina sex during your first week on the pill.

Progestin-Only Pills (POPs or Mini Pills)

You can start progestin-only pills any day of the month. You’ll be protected from pregnancy after 48 hours (2 days). So use another method of birth control (like condoms) if you have penis-in-vagina sex during the first 48 hours.

Slynd (a different type of progestin-only pill) is the exception. 
If you start taking Slynd within the first 5 days of your period, you’ll be protected from pregnancy right away. 
If you start taking Slynd more than 5 days after your period starts, use another method of birth control (like condoms) for the next 7 days if you have vaginal sex.
Your nurse or doctor can help you figure out the best time to start your birth control pills, and when they’ll start working.

If you start using the birth control pill after taking any emergency contraception pill — like Plan B or ella — use a backup birth control method (like condoms) for 7 days.

If you recently took the ella emergency contraception pill, don’t start using your birth control pills until it’s been 6 days or more since you had unprotected sex.

If you took a levonorgestrel emergency contraception pill (like Plan B or other over-the-counter brands), you can start using the pill right away.

What birth control side effects should I expect while taking the pill?,"The hormones in birth control pills may cause side effects in some people. But this doesn’t happen to everyone — many people use the pill with no problems. 

After starting the pill, some people may have: 

Headaches 

Nausea

Sore breasts

Changes in your periods (early, late, or stopping altogether while on the pill)

Spotting (bleeding between periods or brown discharge)

The good news is that these side effects usually go away in 2-3 months. So if you just started the pill and you have side effects that bother you, try to stick it out and give your body a chance to adjust to the hormones. 

Birth control shouldn’t make you feel sick or uncomfortable. If you still don’t like the way the pill makes you feel after a few months, talk with your nurse or doctor. They may suggest another brand of pill or a different birth control method. Some people try a few different types of pills or birth control methods before finding the right one for them. 

And remember: if you stop taking the pill and don’t use another birth control method, you’ll be at risk for pregnancy right away.

The birth control pill has been around for decades, and millions of people have used it safely. Birth control pill side effects aren’t dangerous (though there are some possible risks with taking the pill, like with any medicine). You can always call a nurse or doctor, like the staff at your local Planned Parenthood health center, if you have any concerns while using the pill. 

",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-pill/birth-control-pill-side-effects
Are there good birth control pill side effects?,"Side effects aren’t always a bad thing — many people use the pill because some of the side effects can be really helpful. For example, the hormones in the pill can help with painful, heavy, or irregular periods. The pill may ease cramps and PMS, and it will usually make your period lighter and more regular. You can even use the combination pill to safely skip your period. 

The changes in your periods while on the pill can sometimes make people worry about being pregnant. But the chance of pregnancy is very low as long as you’re taking your pill every day. If you’re worried, you can always take a pregnancy test to be sure.

Some types of birth control pills can also help prevent acne, iron deficiency (anemia), bone thinning, cysts in your breasts and ovaries, and certain cancers.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-pill/how-safe-is-the-birth-control-pill
What are the side effects of stopping the birth control pill?,"Any time there’s a change in your hormones — like when you go on or off hormonal birth control such as the pill — there’s a chance of temporary side effects. But they usually go away after a few months.

When you go off the pill, your body will eventually return to the way it was before you went on it. 

So if the pill made your periods lighter, your periods will probably get heavier once you stop using it. It can also take a few months for your period to go back to the cycle you had before you started taking the pill. And if the pill helped clear up your skin, your acne may come back after you go off the pill. But everyone’s body is different, and our bodies also change over time. For example: you’re less likely to have acne after puberty, so if you started taking the pill in your teens but go off it in your 20s, you may have naturally grown out of your acne by then. 

Another important thing to note: you can get pregnant right away once you stop taking the pill (even if your periods aren’t regular). So if you’re going off the pill but you don’t want to get pregnant, make sure to use another birth control method.

There’s no way to know exactly how your body will react to going off the pill, but any negative side effects that you may have will go away within a few months as your body gets used to being off the hormones.

If you’re really worried about the side effects of going off the pill, talk with your nurse or doctor. They may be able to give you more specific information about what to expect based on your personal medical history.

"Do birth control pills make you gain weight?
","Nope. There’s been a ton of research on the birth control pill, and studies show that using the pill does not make you gain weight. And there are no birth control pills that make you lose weight.

Some people think that the hormones in the pill cause weight gain or weight loss, but that’s not true. The same goes for the birth control ring and birth control patch — these methods of birth control have the same hormones that are in most birth control pills, so the patch and ring won’t change your weight either. The hormonal IUD and the copper IUD also won’t lead to weight gain or loss.

 

There are 2 methods of birth control that may cause weight gain in some people who use them: the birth control shot and the birth control implant. But this doesn’t happen to everybody who uses these types of birth control. Many people use the shot or the implant without gaining weight.

Everyone’s body is different, so birth control affects everyone a little differently. But birth control shouldn’t cause problems in your everyday life — it’s there to help you. So if you think your birth control is making you gain or lose weight and this bothers you, or if you notice other side effects that you don’t like, talk with a nurse or doctor (like the ones at your closest Planned Parenthood health center). They may be able to help you find another brand of pill — or another type of birth control — that works better for you. Many people try a few different methods of birth control before finding one that works well for them.

And remember, if you stop taking the pill, you can get pregnant right away. So if you want to go off the pill but don’t want to get pregnant, make sure you use another method of birth control (like condoms).",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-pill/how-safe-is-the-birth-control-pill
I'm having breakthrough bleeding on the pill. Why is this happening?,"Breakthrough bleeding is when spotting happens while you’re not on your period. Breakthrough bleeding while you’re on the birth control pill is normal and usually nothing to worry about. 

There are many reasons why you may have breakthrough bleeding while on the pill. Hormones in the birth control pill cause changes in your periods as your body adjusts. For most people, this side effect goes away within the first 2-3 months of starting the pill. So giving your body time to get used to the new hormones is important. If you make a mistake with your birth control pills or take the pill continuously (skipping your hormone-free week), you’re more likely to have breakthrough bleeding, even after the first 2-3 months of being on the pill. 

Other things can cause spotting or irregular bleeding that are unrelated to the pill, like uterine fibroids, PCOS, smoking cigarettes, or having certain STDs. You can always speak with a nurse or doctor, like the staff at your local Planned Parenthood health center, if you have any concerns about spotting or heavy bleeding.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-pill/how-safe-is-the-birth-control-pill
"Is it possible to stop having breakthrough bleeding on the pill?
","Breakthrough bleeding while on the birth control pill is common. And while it isn’t usually anything to worry about, it can be annoying. The good news is that these side effects usually go away in the first 2-3 months of starting the pill. Your body takes time to adjust to the hormones in the pill. If the bleeding continues for longer, speak to your nurse or doctor about what may be causing it. 

 Here are a few things that may help lessen your breakthrough bleeding: 

Stay on schedule with your pills, and try not to miss any.

Wait it out a few months to see if your body adjusts and the breakthrough bleeding stops on its own.

If you’re taking the pill continuously and skipping your hormone free week, try scheduling a period every few months. This gives the uterus a chance to shed any built-up lining to reduce irregular spotting and bleeding.

Explore other methods of birth control. Everyone’s body reacts a little differently to different birth control methods, and sometimes it takes a few tries to figure out what works best for you. Even within “the pill” as a method, there are lots of different kinds that may affect your periods and bleeding differently. 

You can always call a nurse or doctor, like the staff at your local Planned Parenthood health center, if you have any concerns while using the pill. ",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-pill/how-safe-is-the-birth-control-pill

Can I take the birth control pill?,"Like all medicines, the pill isn’t for everyone.

Smoking and birth control pills don’t always mix.

If you smoke 15 cigarettes a day or more, don’t use the combination pill (COCs) or any other kind of birth control that has the hormone estrogen.
If you smoke fewer than 15 cigarettes a day or vape nicotine at all, talk with your nurse or doctor about whether the combination pill is safe for you.
Smoking while taking birth control with estrogen (like combination pills, the patch, or the ring), makes you more likely to have problems like a stroke or heart attack.

You can take progestin-only pills (POPs or mini pills) if you’re a smoker. You can also safely use any other method without estrogen — like the birth control shot, the birth control implant, and IUDs.

Also avoid using combination pills if you’ve had:

Blood clots, an inherited blood-clotting disorder, or vein inflammation

Breast cancer

Heart attack, stroke, angina, or other serious heart problems

Migraine headaches with aura (seeing flashing, zigzag lines)

Uncontrolled high blood pressure

Very bad diabetes or liver disease

Avoid using progestin-only pills if you’ve had:

Certain forms of lupus

Breast cancer

Avoid using Slynd (a type of progestin-only pill) if you’ve had:

Kidney disease

Adrenal insufficiency

Liver disease

Cervical, breast, ovarian, uterine, or endometrial cancer

Talk with your doctor or nurse about your health history. They’ll help you decide if the pill is right for you.

What are the risks of birth control pills?,"Even though birth control pills are very safe, using the combination pill can slightly increase your risk of health problems. Complications are rare, but they can be serious. These include heart attack, stroke, blood clots, and liver tumors. In very rare cases, they can lead to death. For the most part, progestin-only pills (aka POPs or mini pills) don’t have these risks.

When talking with your doctor about birth control, tell them about any medications you’re taking and any health problems you’ve had.

There’s a very slight chance that you can get pregnant even if you always take the pill correctly every day. But if you do get pregnant and accidentally take the pill during the early part of your pregnancy, it won’t increase the risk of birth defects.

It’s important to remember that the chance of having any of these problems while taking birth control pills is really, really low for most people. In fact, pregnancy is more likely to cause serious health problems than the pill. Your doctor or nurse can help you figure out which types of birth control will be safest for you.

Is it safe to take the pill while breastfeeding?,"Combination pills (COCs) may reduce the amount and quality of your breast milk in the first 3 weeks of breastfeeding. If you’re nursing, wait at least 3 weeks after giving birth to start using combination pills. Your breast milk will contain traces of the pill's hormones, but it’s not likely that these hormones will have any effect on your baby. Talk with your nurse or doctor if you have any concerns about breastfeeding while using the pill.

Progestin-only pills (AKA POPs or mini pills) are fine to use while you're breastfeeding. In fact, using the mini pill and breastfeeding shouldn’t have any effect on how much milk you produce, and won't affect your baby.

Can I take the birth control pill if I have high blood pressure?,"It depends.

Depending on your age, how well your blood pressure is controlled, and other risk factors, your nurse or doctor can help you decide whether the pill is safe for you.

There are 4 estrogen free (progestin-only) hormonal methods that are safe to use for people with high blood pressure, including progestin-only pills, the birth control shot, the birth control implant, and hormonal IUDs.

What are the different types of birth control pills?,"There are 2 types of birth control pills (combination pills and progestin-only pills), and many different brands.

Combination Pills (COCs):

Combination pills have 2 hormones: estrogen and progestin. Combination pills are the most common type of birth control pill.

As long as you take 1 pill every day, you’ll be protected from pregnancy. You don’t have to take your combination pill at the exact same time every day. But taking it at the same time is a good idea because it helps keep you in the habit of remembering your pill.

Progestin-Only Pills (aka POPs or Mini Pills):
Progestin-only pills have 1 kind of hormone (progestin) — these pills don’t have any estrogen. You must take a progestin-only pill within the same 3 hours every day to be protected from pregnancy.

The one exception is Slynd (a different type of progestin-only pill): you take 1 pill a day, but you don’t need to take Slynd within the same 3-hour window every day. It’s best to take it around the same time if you can to help you stay on schedule.

How do I use the different types of birth control pills?,"Combination Pills (COCs):

As long as you take 1 pill every day, you’ll be protected from pregnancy. You don’t have to take your combination pill at the exact same time every day. But taking it at the same time is a good idea because it helps keep you in the habit of remembering your pill. You can also use an alarm, calendar reminder, or our birth control app to help you remember. Most combination pills come in 28-day or 21-day packs.

If you have 28-day packs:

Take 1 pill every day for 28 days (four weeks) in a row, and then start a new pack on day 29. The last pills in 28-day packs of combination pills do not have hormones in them. These pills are called ""reminder"" or “placebo” pills — they help remind you to take your pill every day and start your next pack on time. How many days you take hormone-free reminder pills depends on the brand of pill. Most pill packs have hormone-free pills for 7 days, but sometimes there are less. The reminder pills may contain iron or other supplements. You get your period during the week you take these reminder pills. You’ll still be protected from pregnancy even if you don’t take the reminder pills — just remember to start your next pack on time.

If you have 21-day packs:

Take 1 pill every day for 21 days (3 weeks) in a row. Then don’t take any pills for seven days (week 4). You’ll get your period during the fourth week while you aren’t taking any pills. It’s important to take every pill in a 21-day pack because there are no reminder (hormone-free) pills. The hormone pills will prevent pregnancy even if you have sex during the week when you don’t take any pills.  Start your next pack after not taking your pills for 7 days — you may want to use an alarm or reminder to help you stay on track.

If you have 91-day packs:

Some combination pills have 12 weeks (3 months) of hormone pills in a row, followed by up to 1 week of hormone-free reminder pills. This is so you’ll only have your period once every 3 months. The hormones will prevent pregnancy even if you have sex during the reminder pill week. You can also use other pill brands to skip your period by skipping the reminder pills. Read more about how to use pills to skip your period.

Progestin-Only Pills (aka POPs or Mini Pills):

You must take progestin-only pills within the same 3 hours every day to be protected from pregnancy. For example, if you take your progestin-only pill at 12:00 p.m., taking it after 3:00 p.m. the next day puts you at risk for pregnancy. Alarms, reminders, or birth control apps can help you take your pill on time.

Progestin-only pills come in 28-day (4 week) packs. Take 1 pill every day for 28 days (4 weeks) in a row, then start a new pack the day after you finish the old pack (day 29). All 28 pills have hormones, so you must take every pill in a progestin-only pack to be protected from pregnancy — there is no hormone-free week. You may get your period during the fourth week. You could also have bleeding on and off throughout the month (spotting), or get no period at all.

There’s also a newer type of progestin-only pill called Slynd that’s a little different than other POPs. Slynd packs have 24 “active” hormone pills and 4 hormone-free “reminder” (placebo) pills. You don’t have to take the hormone-free pills, but make sure you remember to start your next pack on time. And you don’t need to take Slynd within the same 3 hours every day — as long as you take one pill every day, you’ll be protected from pregnancy.

How do I use the pill to stop my period?,"Skipping your period with the combination pill is safe and super easy. Basically you just take a pill with hormones every day and skip your hormone-free “reminder” pills. You can do this two ways:

You can use a brand of pills that has 3 months of hormone pills in a row, so you only get your period 4 times a year.

You can skip the hormone-free reminder pills in your pack and jump right to the next pack. You can do this every month, or just whenever you want to skip your period.

You may have some bleeding or spotting when you use the pill to skip your period — that’s totally normal. If you skip your hormone-free week every month, the spotting should go away after about 6 months.

There’s nothing dangerous or harmful about using the pill to skip your period. And it comes in really handy if you want a special occasion (like a vacation or a hot date) to be period-free.

You can only skip your period with combination pills. If you’re using a progestin-only pill (POP or Mini Pill), take every pill in your pill pack. But many people who use POPs don’t get periods anyway.

"When can I start taking birth control pills?
","You can start taking birth control pills as soon as you get them — any day of the week, and anytime during your menstrual cycle. But when you’ll be protected from pregnancy depends on when you start and the kind of pill you’re using. You may need to use a backup birth control method (like condoms) for up to the first 7 days.

Talk with your nurse or doctor about the best time for you to start taking the pill.

Combination Pills (COCs):

You can start the combination pill at any time.

If you start taking combination pills within 5 days after your period starts, you’ll be protected from pregnancy right away. For example, if you get your period Monday morning, you can start the pill anytime until Saturday morning and be protected from pregnancy right away.

If you start combination pills any other time, you need to take the pill for 7 days before you’re protected from pregnancy. Use another method of birth control — like a condom — if you have penis-in-vagina sex during the first week on the pill.

Progestin-Only Pills (POPs or Mini Pills):

You can start progestin-only pills at any time. You’ll be protected from pregnancy after 48 hours (2 days) on the pill. If you have penis-in-vagina sex during those first 2 days, use another method of birth control, like a condom.

You must take progestin-only pills at the same time every day. If you take it more than 3 hours past your usual time, use a backup method of birth control for the next 48 hours (2 days).

A new type of progestin-only pill called Slynd works a little differently. If you start taking Slynd within the first 5 days of your period, you’ll be protected from pregnancy right away. If you start taking Slynd more than 5 days after your period starts, use another method of birth control (like condoms) for the next 7 days if you have vaginal sex.  And you don’t need to take Slynd within the same 3 hours every day, like you do with other progestin-only pills. As long as you take one pill a day, you’re protected from pregnancy.

Starting the pill after taking emergency contraception:

If you took a levonorgestrel emergency contraception pill (like Plan B or other over-the-counter brands), you can start taking the pill right away. 

If you recently took the ella emergency contraception pill, don’t start taking your birth control pills until it’s been 6 days or more since you had unprotected sex.

If you start using the birth control pill after taking any emergency contraception pill — like Plan B or ella — use a backup birth control method (like condoms) for 7 days.

You can get pregnant again shortly after being pregnant, so talk with your nurse or doctor about starting your birth control as soon as you can.  

You can start taking the progestin-only pill right after an abortion, miscarriage, or childbirth.You can start taking the combination pill right after an abortion or miscarriage.

The pill has health benefits.
Side effects aren’t always a bad thing, and birth control pills aren’t just for birth control. The pill has many perks besides pregnancy prevention.

Both combination and progestin-only pills reduce menstrual cramps, lighten periods, and lower your risk of ectopic pregnancy.

The combination pill can also help prevent or lessen:

acne

bone thinning

cysts in your breasts and ovaries

endometrial and ovarian cancers

serious infections in your ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus

iron deficiency (anemia)

PMS (premenstrual syndrome)

You can get pregnant right away when you stop taking the pill.
Many people on the pill want to have kids when the time is right. One of the great things about the birth control pill is you can get pregnant right after you stop taking it.

After you stop taking the pill, it can take a few months for your periods to return to the cycle you had before you started using it. Once in a while, people have irregular periods or no periods at all for a few months. This is more likely if your periods were irregular before you started taking the pill.

Even if your regular period doesn’t come back right away, it’s still possible to get pregnant when you’re not taking the pill. So if you’re going off the pill but don’t want to get pregnant, start using another birth control method right away.

The pill is convenient.
Taking the birth control pill is easy, but remembering to take it every day can be hard. Luckily, pill packs are small — about the size of a cell phone — so you can carry your pills with you wherever you go. You can use our birth control app to remind you to take your pills everyday.

The pill is birth control you don’t have to think about during sex. If you take the pill correctly, you’re protected from pregnancy all day, every day. Many people say the pill makes their sex lives better because they don’t have to interrupt sex or worry about pregnancy.

You need a prescription from a nurse or doctor to get birth control pills. But you may be able to pick up many packs at once or have them mailed to you. Depending on where you live, you can even get birth control pills online.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-pill/what-are-the-benefits-of-the-birth-control-pill
What are the disadvantages of the pill?,"You have to take the pill every day.
It’s really important to take your birth control pill every day, or you might not be protected from pregnancy. Using our birth control reminder app, setting an alarm, or keeping your pill pack next to things you use every day (like your toothbrush or phone charger) can help you remember to take your pills.

If you have a really busy life and think you might not remember your pill every day, check out other birth control methods like IUDs or the implant that are super low-maintenance and almost impossible to mess up. Explore different birth control methods to find the birth control method that’s best for you.

There can be negative side effects.
Like all medications, birth control pills can have side effects. But most usually go away after 2 or 3 months. Many people use the pill with no problems at all. You can keep track of any side effects with our app.

The most common side effects are spotting or bleeding between periods (this is more common with progestin-only pills), sore breasts, nausea, or headaches. But these usually go away after 2 or 3 months, and they don’t happen to everyone who takes the pill.

Birth control shouldn’t make you feel sick or uncomfortable. Luckily, there are many different types of birth control, so you’ve got options. If you keep having side effects that bother you after using the pill for 3 months, talk with your nurse or doctor about trying another brand of pill or another birth control method. But don’t stop taking the pill without starting a new method, or you won’t be protected from pregnancy.

There can be some rare but serious risks.
Serious problems from taking the birth control pill are very rare. People using birth control that has estrogen, like combination pills, have a slightly higher chance of having a few rare but dangerous problems than people who don’t use birth control with hormones. 

For more information about side effects and risks, talk with your nurse or doctor or read the package insert that came with your pills.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-pill/what-are-the-disadvantages-of-the-pill
What are the side effects of stopping birth control pills?,"The side effects of stopping birth control pills are different for each person, just like the side effects of using them.

The hormones in the pill leave your body in a few days. That means any side effects you experienced while using it will go away pretty quickly. Yes, this includes the positive ones like clearer skin and lighter periods. However, it can take a few weeks to several months for your regular menstrual cycle to return.

Here are some side effects you might experience:

PMS symptoms come back

Mood changes, including a change in sex drive

Changes in vaginal discharge

Change in your periods

Skin changes, like more acne if you had that before taking the pill

Your ability to get pregnant returns as soon as you stop the pill, so if you don’t want to get pregnant right away, keep using your birth control (or use a different method like condoms) until you can get to a doctor or nurse. They can help you make a plan for switching to a new method.

Your periods might be irregular for a while. If you don’t get your period within 3 months after stopping birth control pills, check in with your doctor or nurse to rule out any problems.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-pill/what-are-the-disadvantages-of-the-pill
What is a condom?,"Condoms are thin, stretchy pouches that you wear on your penis during sex. Condoms provide great protection from both pregnancy and STDs. They’re easy to use and easy to get.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/condom
What’s a condom and how does it work?,"Condoms are small, thin pouches that cover your penis during sex and collect semen (cum). Condoms prevent pregnancy by stopping sperm from getting into the vagina, so sperm can’t meet up with an egg. Some types of condoms also help prevent STDs.

There are 3 types of condoms: latex condoms, plastic (non latex) condoms, and lambskin (animal skin) condoms.

Latex condoms

Latex condoms are made from rubber. 

Latex condoms are the most common type of condom.

Latex condoms help protect against both pregnancy and STDs.

Only use water-based or silicone lube with latex condoms — don’t use anything with oil, because oil can damage latex condoms.

Plastic condoms (AKA non latex condoms or latex free condoms)

Plastic/non latex condoms are made from plastics like polyurethane, nitrile, or polyisoprene.
Plastic/non latex condoms are safe for people with latex allergies or sensitivities.
Plastic/non latex condoms help protect against both pregnancy and STDs.
You can use water-based and silicone lube with any kind of plastic condom. You can generally use oil-based lubes with plastic condoms — except for polyisoprene condoms. If you’re not sure whether your lube is safe to use with your condoms, check the directions on the condom package or the brand website of your condoms to make sure.
 

Lambskin condoms (aka animal skin condoms)

Lambskin condoms are made from the lining of animal intestines (usually sheep).

Lambskin condoms only help protect against pregnancy — they don’t prevent STDs.

Lambskin condoms are safe for people who are allergic or sensitive to latex.

You can use any kind of lube, including oils, with lambskin condoms.

Along with helping to prevent pregnancy, latex and plastic condoms also help prevent STDs by covering the penis — this prevents contact with semen and vaginal fluids, and limits skin-to-skin contact that can spread sexually transmitted infections. Lambskin condoms do NOT protect against STDs, because there are tiny holes in the lambskin that are small enough to block sperm but big enough to let bacteria and viruses through. So it’s best to use latex or plastic condoms to help prevent both STDs and pregnancy.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/condom
Do condoms help protect against STDs?,"Yes! Using condoms every time you have oral, anal, or vaginal sex is the best way to reduce your chances of getting or spreading sexually transmitted infections. Condoms protect you and your partners from STDs by preventing contact with bodily fluids (like semen and vaginal fluids) that can carry infections. And because condoms cover your penis, they help protect against certain STDs like herpes and genital warts that are spread through skin-to-skin contact (but they’re somewhat less effective with these because they don’t cover all your skin).

Pro-tip: if you cut a condom up the side, you can open it out and put it over the vulva for safer oral sex there. Condoms are helpful for everyone!

Condoms are the only type of birth control out there that also help protect against STDs. So even if you’re using another form of birth control (like the pill), it’s a good idea to also use condoms to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections.

Keep in mind that condoms made of lambskin or other animal membranes DO NOT protect against STDs — they only prevent pregnancy. Only synthetic condoms (latex or plastic) prevent the spread of STDs.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/condom
Do you need a condom for oral sex?,"The main ways people get STDs are from vaginal and anal sex, but it’s possible to get some infections from oral sex. STDs that can infect your lips, mouth, and throat include herpes, HPV, gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and hepatitis B. 

So if you’re trying to get the most STD protection possible during sexual contact, you can use condoms during oral sex on a penis, and dams during oral sex on a vulva and/or anus. Condoms and dams help protect both you and your partner from skin-to-skin contact and sexual fluids that can spread STDs.

You can use any latex or plastic (latex-free) condom for oral sex on a penis. Some people prefer plastic condoms for oral sex so they don’t have to taste latex, or unlubricated condoms so they don’t get lube in their mouths. There are flavored condoms that are made for oral sex, and you can also add flavored lube to any plastic or latex condom. If you have a vagina, avoid using flavored products for vaginal or anal sex because they can lead to irritation, yeast infections, or bacterial vaginosis. And don’t use animal skin (aka lambskin) condoms because they only help prevent pregnancy, not STDs. 

Dams can be harder to find than condoms. You can buy dams online, or in some sex shops or drug stores. You may also be able to find them at some sexual health centers, like your local Planned Parenthood. You can also make a dam by cutting open a condom or internal condom — just cut the tip off so it’s open at both ends, cut the condom from the bottom to the top, open it up, and lay it over your partner’s vulva and/or anus.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/condom
"Do condoms protect against all STDs?
","Condoms help protect against all STDs, but they provide more protection from some STDs than others.

There are lots of different STDs. Some are carried in body fluids like semen (cum), vaginal fluids, and blood — these include HIV, gonorrhea, chlamydia, hepatitis B, and trichomoniasis. Others can be passed from skin-to-skin touching with an infected body area, like your mouth or genitals — these include herpes, HPV and genital warts, syphilis, public lice (crabs), and scabies.

If you use condoms correctly, they work very well to prevent STDs that are carried in body fluids. But condoms are a little less effective at preventing skin-to-skin STDs — that’s because these infections can sometimes live on areas of the body that condoms don’t block, like the scrotum, upper thighs, buttocks (butt cheeks), and labia. For example, if someone has herpes sores or genital warts on their scrotum or around the base of their penis where a condom doesn’t reach, they could give the infection to their partner during sex.

This may sound scary, but it’s important to remember that most skin-to-skin STDs aren’t dangerous and don’t cause serious health problems. And all STDs can be treated or managed with medication — that’s why STD testing is so important, so you can get treatment right away if you do happen to have an STD.

The only way to be 100% sure you’ll never get an STD is to never have sexual contact with another person — but most people have sex at some point in their lives. And some protection is definitely better than nothing. So if you’re going to be sexually active, using condoms is the best way to help prevent STDs and protect yourself and your partner. ",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/condom
How effective are condoms against pregnancy?,"If you use condoms perfectly every single time you have sex, they’re 98% effective at preventing pregnancy. But people aren’t perfect, so in real life condoms are about 87% effective — that means about 13 out of 100 people who use condoms as their only birth control method will get pregnant each year.

The better you are about using condoms correctly every time you have sex, the better they’ll work. But there’s a small chance that you will get pregnant even if you always use them the right way.

Want even more protection from pregnancy? Check out IUDs and implants. You can also explore different birth control methods to find which may be best for you.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/condom/how-effective-are-condoms
How can I make condoms more effective?,"The best way to make condoms work as well as possible is to use them correctly every single time you have vaginal, oral, and anal sex. That means wearing it the whole time, from start to finish. Make sure the condom is rolled on your penis the right way before there’s any skin-to-skin genital contact. Read more about how to use condoms correctly.

Using condoms + another form of birth control (like the pill, IUD, or shot) is a great way to get extra pregnancy prevention AND protection against STDs. Using withdrawal (“pulling out”) while also wearing a condom can help keep sperm out of the vagina and lower the risk for pregnancy.

You don't need to wear two condoms at the same time, and don't use a condom worn on the penis together with an internal condom. As long as you're using it correctly, one condom is all the protection you need. Also make sure your condoms aren't expired by checking the date on the wrapper or box.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/condom/how-effective-are-condoms
How effective are spermicide condoms?,"Some condoms come pre-lubricated with a little bit of spermicide (a chemical that helps stop sperm from swimming to an egg). These are called spermicidal condoms. It seems like spermicidal condoms would be more effective than regular condoms, but that’s not true. Spermicidal condoms and regular condoms both work equally well to prevent pregnancy.

In order for spermicide to be effective at preventing pregnancy, you need to put a lot of it deep in your vagina. That’s why most types of spermicide come with applicators or in pre-measured doses that help you use the right amount. Spermicidal condoms only have a thin layer of spermicide on them, and it’s not enough to give you any extra protection from pregnancy.

Using spermicidal condoms is definitely better than using no condoms at all. And using a separate spermicide plus a condom can give you some extra protection from pregnancy. But when it comes to using condoms alone, regular condoms are just as effective as spermicidal condoms. And when used correctly, condoms are really good at preventing both pregnancy and STDs.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/condom/how-effective-are-condoms
How do I use a condom?,"Roll the condom on when your penis is erect (hard), but BEFORE it touches your partner’s mouth or genital area (vulva, vagina, anus, buttocks, and upper thighs) — and wear it the whole time you’re having sex. This helps protect you from STDs that are transmitted through skin-to-skin touching. It also prevents contact with pre-ejaculate (pre-cum), which can have STD germs and may rarely contain sperm that can cause pregnancy.


1. Condoms last a long time, but you should always check the expiration date printed on the wrapper or box. Open condoms carefully so you don’t damage them — don’t use your teeth or scissors.

 


2. Make sure the condom's ready to roll on the right way: the rim should be on the outside so it looks like a little hat, and it will unroll easily. You can unroll it a little bit before putting it on to make sure it’s right-side out. If you accidentally put a condom on inside out, do NOT flip it around and reuse it — get a new one.

 


3. Pinch the tip of the condom and place it on the head of your penis. Leave a little bit of space at the top to collect semen (cum). If you’re uncircumcised, it might be more comfortable to pull your foreskin back before placing the condom on the tip of your penis and rolling it down.

 


4. Unroll the condom down the shaft of your penis all the way to the base.

You can put a few drops of water-based or silicone lubricant inside the tip of the condom before you roll it on. You can also add more lube to the outside of the condom after it's on your penis. (Water-based or silicone lube can make sex feel even better, and it helps stop condoms from breaking.)

 

5. Have sex!

 

6. After you ejaculate (cum), hold onto the rim of the condom and pull your penis out of your partner’s body. 

Do this BEFORE your penis goes soft, so the condom doesn’t get too loose and let semen out.

 


7. Carefully take off the condom away from your partner so you don’t accidentally spill semen (cum) on them. Throw the condom away in the garbage — don’t flush it down the toilet (it can clog pipes).

You can’t reuse condoms. Roll on a new condom every time you have vaginal, oral, or anal sex. You should also use a new condom if you switch from one kind of sex to another (like anal to vaginal).

Don’t worry if you lose your erection (your penis gets soft) while wearing a condom — this is super common. If this happens you should change condoms. Just take the condom off, and once your penis is hard again, roll on a new one.

What are some tips for using condoms?,"Taking good care of your condoms and using them correctly every single time you have sex is key.

Store your condoms in a cool, dry place away from any sharp objects and direct sunlight. Don’t keep them in your pocket, car, or bathroom for long periods of time (over 1 month), because excessive heat and moisture can damage condoms over time.

Always check the expiration date and make sure there aren’t holes in the packaging before opening your condom — you should be able to feel a little air bubble when you squeeze the wrapper. If a condom is torn, dry, stiff, or sticky, throw it away.

Since you have to use a new condom every time you have sex or get a new erection, it’s a good idea to keep a supply around. Have condoms nearby before things start heating up, so they’re easy to grab without interrupting the action.

Most condoms come pre-lubricated, but adding extra water-based or silicone lube can make condoms feel great and help keep them from breaking. Put a few drops on the head of your penis or inside the tip of your condom before you roll it on, and/or spread lube on the outside of the condom once you’re wearing it.

Don’t use anything that has oil in it with latex or polyisoprene condoms, like petroleum jelly (Vaseline), lotion, baby oil, butter, or cooking oils. Oil damages latex and polyisoprene condoms and may cause them to break.

It’s easy to make condoms fun and sexy — all it takes is a little creativity and a positive attitude! For many people, condoms are a natural part of foreplay. Having your partner roll on the condom, applying lube, and stimulating each other and saying sexy stuff while putting condoms on keeps things hot AND safe. Plus, knowing you’re protecting each other from pregnancy and/or STDs lets everyone relax and focus on feelin’ good.

Practice makes perfect, so it’s a good idea to get used to putting on condoms before you actually use one for sex. You can practice putting a condom on your own penis, or a banana, cucumber, or slim bottle — anything penis-shaped will do! Becoming a condom pro BEFORE you have sex makes it much easier to use them correctly when it really matters.

Lastly, it’s a good idea to use another form of birth control, like the pill, ring, shot, implant, or IUD, along with condoms. It can help prevent pregnancy in case you make a mistake or the condom breaks, giving you extra protection. If you have a condom mishap and you’re not on another birth control method, emergency contraception (the morning-after pill) can help prevent pregnancy up to 5 days after unprotected sex.

"What happens if you put a condom on inside out?
","It’s important to use condoms correctly. If you don’t use a condom the right way — like putting it on inside out — it won’t work as well.

When you put a condom on inside out, it will be a lot harder to roll down. It might not cover your penis all the way, and it could slip off during sex. Most condoms have a reservoir tip — a little extra pocket at the top that helps collect semen (cum) during ejaculation. When a condom is inside out, this reservoir tip might not work as well and the condom can break easier. 

If you accidentally put a condom on inside out, it might be tempting to flip it around and roll it back on the right way. But that’s not a good idea because once the condom goes on your penis it can pick up fluids (like pre-cum) that can spread STDs or cause pregnancy. So the best thing to do is throw the condom away and get a new one.

In order to make sure you use a condom the right way, look at it carefully before you put it on. The roll of the rim should be on the outside, with the reservoir tip poking up in the middle. You can also unroll the condom a little before you put it on so you can figure out which way is correct. ",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/condom/how-to-put-a-condom-on

Some people feel kind of awkward going into a store and buying condoms, but your health is more important than a little embarrassment. Besides, buying condoms shouldn’t be embarrassing in the first place — it means you’re being responsible, and protecting yourself and your partner.

If you feel like you absolutely can’t go into a store and buy condoms for yourself, ask someone you trust for help. You can also visit a Planned Parenthood health center or other community health center for condoms and advice about birth control and STDs.

How much do condoms cost?,"You don’t have to spend a ton of money to protect yourself from pregnancy and STDs. Condoms are usually inexpensive, and can even be free.

On average, condoms cost about a dollar each, but it may be less or more depending on the brand, store, and package — most of the time larger packs end up being a better value. Boxes of 3 go for about $2 to $6. In packages of 12 or more, condoms usually cost less than $1 each. So stocking up on condoms not only helps you be prepared, it can also save money.

Affordable or free condoms are often available at Planned Parenthood health centers, family planning clinics, your local health department, community centers, college health centers, or your doctor’s office.

Lambskin and other animal membrane condoms only prevent pregnancy — they don’t protect you from HIV or other STDs.

When it comes to effectiveness, using condoms correctly every time you have sex is more important than buying a certain brand. All latex and plastic condoms provide similar protection against pregnancy and STDs. Whether they’re flavored, ribbed or studded, or regular ol’ condoms, just check the box or wrapper to make sure it says that the condom protects against STDs and pregnancy.

Condoms come in different sizes, textures, shapes, and even flavors (for oral sex). You can try different types of condoms to find the one that you like best. Condoms are very stretchy and versatile, so most people will fit into a basic condom comfortably. If you find that standard condoms feel too tight, buy a larger size. If condoms tend to slip around a lot or fall off during sex, try a smaller size.

Condoms last a long time, but they break down with age and when they’re not stored properly. No matter where you get your condoms, check them out before use. Make sure the wrapper doesn’t have holes or leaks and the expiration date hasn’t passed.

The best way to figure out what size condom you need is to try different ones. Start with a regular condom. Does it roll on easily and stay in place? It’s the right size. If it feels loose or seems to slip off, go for a smaller size. (They’re labeled “small” or “snug.”) And if it’s painfully tight or looks like it’ll tear, try a bigger size.

Condoms are effective against STDs.
Condoms and internal condoms are the only methods of birth control that also help prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections like HIV, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. Even if you’re already using a different kind of birth control to avoid pregnancy, it’s a good idea to also use condoms or internal condoms every time you have sex to protect yourself from STDs.

Condoms don’t cost much and are convenient.
Condoms are super easy to get from many different stores, community health centers, Planned Parenthood health centers, and online. You don’t need a prescription or ID to buy them, and they’re inexpensive (or sometimes even free). Condoms are a small, discreet, and portable way to get big protection from pregnancy and STDs.

Condoms can be sexy.
Protection is important, but so is pleasure. Luckily, condoms offer both!

Condoms come in lots of different styles, shapes, and textures that increase sensation for both partners. And having your partner put the condom on your penis can be a sexy part of foreplay, especially if you add lube. Condoms can even delay ejaculation (cumming), so sex lasts longer.

You can use condoms for oral, anal, and vaginal sex, so they protect you from STDs no matter how you get down. And that’s really the sexiest part of all: condoms let you focus on pleasure and your partner without worrying about pregnancy or STDs. Safer sex is better sex because it stops stress from killing the mood.

Condoms help other methods of birth control work even better.
Adding condoms to your birth control lineup can give you extra pregnancy protection. No method is 100% effective, so adding condoms as a backup helps you prevent pregnancy if you make a mistake with your other method or it fails. And it’s a good idea to use condoms to help protect yourself against STDs as well.

Condoms can add extra protection to almost all other birth control methods, like the pill, shot, ring, IUD, and implant. However, don’t use the internal condom and male condom together, and there’s no need to wear more than one condom at a time. One should do the trick.

Condoms have no side effects.
Most people can use condoms with no problem — there are no side effects. Rarely, latex (rubber) condoms can cause irritation for people with latex allergies or sensitivities. And sometimes the lube on certain types of condoms may be irritating.

If you’re allergic to latex, try switching brands or using plastic condoms. Condoms and internal condoms made from soft plastics like polyurethane, polyisoprene, and nitrile are latex-free.

There are a ton of different types of condoms, so everyone can find one that fits right and feels good. Some condoms are actually designed to make sex more pleasurable: textures like studs and ribbing, colors, flavors, and ultra-thin materials, and even special lubricants can all add to the fun.

Using condoms as part of foreplay can be sexy and exciting. You can keep kissing and stimulating each other while getting the condom out, and your partner can put the condom on and add lube. That way, the condom becomes part of the action instead of stopping the action.

","No. The internal condom comes in one size. Internal condoms are similar in length to condoms that are meant for penises, but internal condoms are much wider.

How can I make internal condoms more effective?,"The best way to make internal condoms work as well as possible is to use them correctly every single time you have vaginal or anal sex. That means wearing it the whole time, from start to finish. Make sure the condom is in place in your vagina or anus the right way before there’s any skin-to-skin genital contact. Read more about how to use internal condoms correctly.

You can make internal condoms better at preventing pregnancy by using them along with another birth control method (like the pill or an IUD). That way you’ve got some protection from STDs, and double protection from pregnancy.

One thing you should definitely NOT do is use a regular condom together with an internal condom. Each kind of condom is designed to be used on its own, and doubling up won’t give you extra protection. One condom used correctly is the best way to go — whichever kind of condom you use.

Keep in mind that drugs and alcohol can make people forget to use condoms (or less able to use them correctly).

How do I use internal condoms?,"The internal condom is bigger than a regular condom, but don’t worry: it’s not uncomfortable when you insert it correctly. 


How to put in an internal condom:

1. Check the expiration date on the package, and then open it carefully.

2. The internal condom comes already lubricated, but you can add more lube if you want.

3. If you’re putting the condom in your anus, remove the inner ring. If you’re putting the condom in your vagina, leave the ring in.

4. Relax and get into a comfortable position. Standing with one foot on a chair, lying down, or squatting are common faves.

 


5. If it’s going in your vagina, squeeze together the sides of the inner ring at the closed end of the condom and slide it in like a tampon. Push the inner ring into your vagina as far as it can go, up to your cervix.

6. If it’s going in your anus, just push the condom in with your finger.

 


7. Make sure the condom isn't twisted.

Pull out your finger and let the outer ring hang about an inch outside the vagina or anus. You’re good to go!

 


8. Hold the condom open as the penis or sex toy is going into the condom to make sure it doesn’t slip to the side between the condom and your vagina or anus.

 

How to remove an internal condom:

1. If there’s semen (cum) in the condom, twist the outer ring (the part that’s hanging out) to keep the semen inside the pouch.

2. Gently pull it out of your vagina or anus, being careful not to spill the semen if there is any.

3. Throw it away in the trash (never flush any kind of condom, because it can clog your toilet).

4. Internal condoms are not reusable — use a new one every time you have sex.

 

It’s totally normal for the internal condom to move around a little bit during sex, but the penis/sex toy should be completely surrounded by the condom at all times. Stop if the penis/sex toy slips out of the condom into your vagina or anus, or if the outer ring gets pushed into your vagina or anus. If there’s no semen (cum), you can gently remove the condom and put it back in place.

If cum or pre-cum gets outside the internal condom near your vagina or anus, you may want to think about getting tested for STDs.

If cum or pre-cum gets near your vulva or into your vagina — and you’re worried about pregnancy — you can still prevent pregnancy with  emergency contraception (the morning-after pill). Emergency contraception can prevent pregnancy up to five days after unprotected sex.

One of the coolest things about the internal condom is you can put it in ahead of time, before foreplay and sex, so you don’t have to interrupt the action when it’s time to get busy. Your partner can even get in on the fun and insert the condom for you.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/internal-condom/how-do-i-use-an-internal-condom

What are the advantages of internal condoms?,"Internal condoms (AKA female condoms) have lots of benefits. You’re protecting yourself from both pregnancy and STDs when you wear one, so they take the worry out of sex. Plus: they’re hypoallergenic if you’re sensitive to latex and can even increase sexual pleasure — seriously.

Internal condoms help prevent STDs.
Condoms and internal condoms are the only methods of birth control that also help prevent sexually transmitted infections like HIV, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. Even if you’re already using a different kind of birth control to avoid pregnancy, it’s a good idea to also use condoms or internal condoms every time you have sex to help protect yourself against STDs. That’s an important part of taking care of yourself.

They’re latex-free and comfortable.
Good news for people who have latex allergies or sensitivities: internal condoms are made from a soft plastic material called nitrile. They’re totally hypoallergenic and won’t irritate sensitive genital skin.  

Because internal condoms are larger than male condoms and don’t fit snugly around a penis, they give your partner’s penis more breathing room, which some people find more comfortable.

Internal condoms can increase sexual pleasure.
Using internal condoms can make sex better. Seriously.

You can insert the internal condom ahead of time, before you start gettin’ busy, which keeps things hot and spontaneous with no interruptions. And having your partner put the internal condom in for you turns safer sex into intimate and sexy foreplay.

But it doesn’t stop there! During vaginal sex, the internal condom’s inner ring may stimulate the tip of the penis, and the external ring can rub against your vulva and clitoris. That little something extra can feel great for both of you.

Internal condoms give you control.
Internal condoms are a small, discreet, and portable way to get big protection from pregnancy and STDs.

Since all the other condoms out there are worn on a penis, many internal condom fans love that there’s a condom they can control. Internal condoms let you take charge of your sexual health. Even if your partner doesn’t want to wear a condom, you can still protect yourself.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/internal-condom/what-are-the-advantages-of-internal-condoms
What are the disadvantages of using internal condoms?,"Internal condoms may take a bit of practice to get used to. And for them to work, you have to use them correctly every single time you have sex.

You have to use one every time you have sex.
In order for internal condoms to work as well as possible, you have to use a new one every time you have vaginal or anal sex — and you have to use them correctly. Having a supply of condoms and keeping them nearby (like in your purse or next to your bed) makes it easier to use them.

If you’re not sure that you’ll be able to use internal condoms every single time you have sex, there are plenty of other types of birth control out there that are easier to use and offer better protection against pregnancy (like IUDs and implants).

Explore different birth control methods to see which may be best for you. But remember: whatever kind of birth control you’re on, adding either internal or male condoms every time you have sex is the best way to reduce your risk of STDs.

Internal condoms take some getting used to.
Stopping to put on a condom may take you out of the moment. Or maybe you think the way internal condoms look hanging out of your vagina or anus kind of kills the mood.

If you feel this way, there are a few solutions you can try to make internal condoms work for you:

Practice makes better: If you get used to internal condoms, you’ll be more comfortable and confident.

Change your attitude: rather than getting annoyed about having to use a internal condom, focus on the sex part (and how awesome it is that condoms let you do it without stressing about pregnancy and STDs).

Make internal condoms part of foreplay: keep the fire going by continuing to stimulate each other and being your fine, sexy selves while you or your partner insert the internal condom. You won’t feel like you’re stopping anything — it’s all part of the action.

Some people may feel irritation on their vagina, vulva, penis or anus when they use the internal condom. It’s typically just caused by friction, so adding extra lubricant usually takes care of it. Even if you don’t have any discomfort, lube can really increase pleasure and sensation during sex — especially when using condoms.

What are the risks of using a diaphragm?,"Diaphragms are supposed to be used with spermicide for the best protection from pregnancy. For most people, using spermicide is totally safe. However, the chemical in most spermicides, nonoxynol-9, has some risks. If you use it many times a day, it can irritate your vagina and increase your risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. If you’re worried about the spread of STDs, use condoms along with your diaphragm and spermicide to protect yourself and your partners.

Some people who use diaphragms get urinary tract infections (UTIs) a lot. If this happens to you, check with your nurse or doctor — you may need a different size.

If you notice that your vagina feels sore or irritated after you use your diaphragm with spermicide, you may be sensitive to the spermicide or the material that the diaphragm is made of. You can try a different brand of spermicide and see if that makes a difference. If the irritation feels really bad or if switching brands doesn't help, talk to your doctor.

You should also talk to a nurse or doctor if:

it burns when you urinate (pee)

the diaphragm feels uncomfortable

you have spotting or bleeding that's different from your normal period

your vulva or vagina is sore, itchy, or red

you have discharge from your vagina that's different from your normal discharge

Diaphragms don’t interrupt sex.
You can put your diaphragm in up to 2 hours before you have sex (that's how long the chemicals in spermicide work). Getting your pregnancy protection in place before things get hot and heavy means you don’t have to stop and worry about birth control in the heat of the moment.

"When can I put a sponge in?
","The birth control sponge starts working as soon as you activate the spermicide with water and put it in your vagina.

The sponge can be inserted up to 24 hours before sex, so you can get your birth control in place BEFORE the action starts — interruption free.  And once the sponge is in, you can have sex as many times as you want in the next 24 hours without replacing it.

How long do I leave the sponge in?,"Always leave the sponge in place for at least 6 hours after sex, but don’t leave the sponge in your vagina for more than 30 hours total. (This means you can safely have sex for up to 24 hours after putting in the sponge, and still leave it in for the required 6 hours after sex.)

You don’t have to leave the sponge in for the full 30 hours — just make sure you leave it in for at least 6 hours after the last time you had sex.

How do I take the sponge out?,"Slide a clean finger inside your vagina and hook it around the fabric loop on the bottom of the sponge. Then slowly and gently glide the sponge out of your vagina. You can grab the sponge itself to pull it out if you can’t find the fabric loop.

If you have a hard time reaching the sponge, bear down (push with your vaginal muscles like you’re going to the bathroom) while reaching for it.

Toss the used sponge into the trash — don’t flush it down the toilet.

Sponges aren’t reusable, and you can’t take them out and put them back in. Each sponge is only good for one 24-hour period once it’s inside your vagina.

Is the sponge safe for me?,"The birth control sponge may have side effects, but it’s totally safe for most people. Some conditions make the sponge harder to use.

Most people can use the contraceptive sponge safely and easily, but it may not be right for you if:

you’re allergic or sensitive to spermicide, sulfites, or polyurethane

you're not comfortable putting your fingers in your vagina

you have trouble putting in the sponge

you’ve recently had an abortion, miscarriage, or birth

you have an infection in or around your vagina

you have a history of toxic shock syndrome (TSS)

You shouldn't use the sponge when you have your period or have any kind of vaginal bleeding. Using the sponge can increase your risk of toxic shock syndrome, a rare but serious disease.

",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-sponge/how-safe-sponge
What are the risks of the sponge?,"Nonoxynol-9, the ingredient in the sponge’s spermicide, may irritate your vagina. That irritation increases your risk for HIV and other STDs because it gives infections an easy pathway into your body. (Using condoms along with your sponge is a great way to help prevent the spread of STDs and get extra protection from pregnancy.)

If your vagina or your partner’s penis feels sore or irritated after having sex with the sponge in, one of you may be sensitive to its ingredients. If you rule out other possible causes, like an STD or a sensitivity to any latex condoms and/or lubricants you may be using, and the irritation keeps happening when you use the sponge, it may not be a good birth control method for you.

Sponge users may be at a slightly increased risk of toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a super rare but serious disease. Warning signs of TSS include:

a sudden high fever

a rash that looks and feels like a sunburn

diarrhea or vomiting

a sore throat

aching muscles and joints

dizziness, faintness, and weakness

If you notice any of these symptoms, take out your sponge and call a doctor right away.

To lower your risk for TSS:

Don’t leave the sponge in place longer than 30 hours.

Don’t use the sponge soon after an abortion, giving birth, or a miscarriage. Ask your doctor when it’s safe to use the sponge.

Never use the sponge during your period.

What are the benefits of the sponge?,"Birth control sponges give you 24 hours of pregnancy protection, no prescription required. They’re easy to get and easy to use.

Sponges are convenient and give you control.
You don’t need to see a doctor or have a prescription to get the sponge, and it’s sold over-the-counter at most drugstores, some supermarkets, community health centers, Planned Parenthood health centers, and online. 

Contraceptive sponges are small, individually wrapped, and easily fit in your pocket or bag — wherever you go, the sponge can go with you!  And once you put the sponge in, you can have sex as many times as you want for the next 24 hours.

The sponge is effective as soon as you put it in, and it’s easy to stop using it, too. If you decide that you want to try to get pregnant, just don’t put a sponge in before sex.

Sponges don’t interrupt sex.
You can safely put your sponge in up to 24 hours before sex, so you don’t have to worry about birth control in the heat of the moment. Putting your sponge in place before things get hot and heavy means you can take care of pregnancy prevention without pausing the action. And once the sponge is in your vagina, you can have sex multiple times for the next 24 hours without doing anything else.

Most people can’t feel the sponge once it’s in their vagina, and many partners don’t feel it during sex. The sponge is soft, squishy, and feels a lot like a vagina, so even partners who do notice it usually don’t care. Plus, knowing that you're protected from pregnancy can help you relax and enjoy sex more.

The sponge is a hormone-free option.
Some people prefer non-hormonal birth control, or can’t use methods with hormones because of medical problems — the sponge can be a good option for them. And because it’s hormone-free, it’s safe to use the sponge while breastfeeding.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-sponge/what-are-benefits-sponge
What are the disadvantages of using the sponge?,"You have to use one every time you have sex.
In order for birth control sponges to work as well as possible, you have to use one every time you have vaginal sex — and you have to use it correctly. Luckily, you can put the sponge in up to 24 hours before sex, so you can prepare for interruption-free action. And you can have sex as many times as you want during the 24 hours after you put the sponge in.

If you’re not sure that you’ll be able to use the sponge every single time you have vaginal sex, there are plenty of other types of birth control out there that are easier to use and offer better protection against pregnancy (like IUDs and implants). You can explore different birth control methods to find a method that’s best for you.

Whatever type of birth control you’re on, adding condoms every time you have sex is the best way to reduce your risk of STDs (and get extra protection from pregnancy).

The sponge can be hard to use correctly
Some people have trouble inserting the sponge, and it can take some practice to get really good at it. You also have to make sure you leave the sponge in for at least 6 hours after the last time you had sex, but no more than 30 hours total.

It’s really important to use the sponge the right way, or it won’t work as well to prevent pregnancy. So make sure to follow the directions that come in the package.

You may have trouble removing a sponge every once in a while. If you have a hard time getting to the sponge, bear down (push with your vaginal muscles like you’re going to the bathroom) while reaching for it. You can grab the sponge itself and pull it out if you can’t find the fabric loop.

The sponge doesn’t prevent the spread of STDs.
Sponges do NOT protect you from STDS. The sponge can actually increase your risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections because the spermicide in sponges can irritate your vagina and make it easier for STD germs to enter your body.

The good news is adding condoms to the mix helps protect you from STDs and — bonus! — gives you an extra boost of pregnancy prevention. If you’re going to have sex, using condoms every time and getting tested regularly are the best ways to avoid STDs.

The sponge may have side effects
Some people are sensitive to Nonoxynol-9, the ingredient in the sponge’s spermicide. It can cause irritation that’s unpleasant and may even increase your risk for HIV and other STDs. (Using condoms along with your sponge is a great way to help prevent the spread of STDs and get extra protection from pregnancy.)

Sponge users may also have a slightly higher risk of toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a super rare but serious disease. Read more about sponge safety.

Some people complain that the sponge is wet and messy. Others find that the sponge absorbs vaginal wetness and makes sex too dry, but adding a water-based or silicone lubricant will help keep things slippery and comfortable. The spermicide in the sponge may taste a little weird if you get it in your mouth.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-sponge/what-are-disadvantages-using-sponge
What’s spermicide?,"Spermicide is a kind of birth control that has chemicals that stop sperm from reaching an egg. You put it in your vagina before sex to prevent pregnancy. 

You don’t need a prescription to get spermicide — you can buy it over-the-counter at most drugstores, pharmacies, and superstores in the condom aisle.

There’s also a new kind of vaginal contraceptive gel called Phexxi. Phexxi isn’t a spermicide, but you use it in a similar way — you put the gel in your vagina before sex, and it helps stop sperm from meeting with an egg. You need a prescription from a nurse or doctor to get Phexxi.

Both spermicide and Phexxi are non-hormonal birth control options.

",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/spermicide
How does spermicide work?,"Spermicide is a chemical that you put deep into your vagina right before sex. It prevents pregnancy two ways: blocking the entrance to the cervix so sperm can’t get to your egg, and stopping sperm from moving well enough to swim to your egg.

Spermicide can be used by itself, or combined with other birth control methods. Using spermicide plus a condom gives you extra protection from pregnancy (bonus: condoms prevent STDs, too).

And you need to use spermicide with diaphragms and cervical caps in order for them to work.

Fun fact: the root word “cide” in “spermicide” means “to kill.” Spermicide doesn’t actually “kill” sperm, but it slows it down so it can’t reach an egg.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/spermicide
What are the different kinds of spermicide?,"Spermicide comes in many different forms: creams, gels, film, foams, and suppositories (soft inserts that melt into a cream inside your vagina).

There are lots of different spermicide brands and types out there, but they all work in a similar way — blocking the cervix and stopping sperm from moving. The best kind of spermicide to use is the one you like the most.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/spermicide
"What are the ingredients in spermicide?
","The main ingredient that prevents pregnancy in spermicide is nonoxynol-9. Nonoxynol-9 is a chemical that makes sperm stop moving, preventing it from joining with an egg.  

Using condoms with spermicide every time you have sex and getting tested regularly for STDs is the best way to help keep you and your partners healthy.

If you’re having sex more than once or twice a day, using nonoxynol-9 can irritate your genital tissue and increase your risk of HIV and other STDs. The irritation increases your risk because it gives infections an easier way into your body.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/spermicide
How effective is spermicide?,"Like all birth control methods, spermicide is most effective when you use it correctly every single time you have vaginal sex. Be sure to read the directions that come with your type of spermicide and use it every time you have sex, or it won’t work as well.

When it comes to the numbers, 18 out of 100 people who use spermicide will become pregnant each year, even if they always use it correctly. But using spermicide perfectly is hard, so in reality about 21 out of 100 people who use spermicide become pregnant every year — that means spermicide is 79% effective at preventing pregnancy.

Using spermicide alone isn’t the most effective way to prevent pregnancy, but it’s better than using no birth control at all. If you’re serious about preventing pregnancy, use spermicide along with another method, like condoms or withdrawal (pulling out).

Looking for birth control that offers maximum protection from pregnancy? Check out IUDs and the implant. They’re the most effective kinds of birth control.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/spermicide/how-effective-spermicide

The best way to increase your pregnancy prevention powers is to use spermicide along with another birth control method.

What’s the difference between cervical caps and diaphragms?,"Cervical caps are smaller than diaphragms and the shape is a little different: diaphragms are shaped like a dish, and cervical caps look like a sailor’s hat. They both work with spermicide and cover your cervix to prevent pregnancy.

You can leave the cervical cap in longer than a diaphragm (up to 2 days), but diaphragms are slightly more effective at preventing pregnancy. Your nurse or doctor can help you decide which one is better for you.

How effective are cervical caps?,"The cervical cap is a lot more effective if you've never given birth.

For people who’ve never given birth, the cervical cap is 86% effective — that means that out of 100 people who use the cap, about 14 of them will get pregnant within a year.

For people who have given birth, the cervical cap is 71% effective — that means that out of 100 people who use the cap, about 29 of them will get pregnant within a year.

Like all birth control methods, the cervical cap is most effective when you use it correctly every time you have sex. If you don’t always follow the directions or use your cervical cap every single time you have sex, it won’t work as well.

Want an even more effective form of birth control? Check out IUDs and implants. They’re the most effective kinds of birth control.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/cervical-cap/how-effective-are-cervical-caps

Use spermicide with your cervical cap, and add more spermicide if you have sex again before taking out your cervical cap.

Put your cervical cap in before you start having sex, ideally before you feel aroused.

Make sure the cervical cap is covering your cervix. (Here’s how to use a cervical cap).

Use another method of birth control along with your cervical cap. Your partner can pull out before ejaculating (withdrawal), or wear a condom. Bonus: Condoms also help protect you and your partner from sexually transmitted infections.

Always leave your cervical cap in place for at least 6 hours after the last time you had sex.

What are the risks of using a cervical cap?,"Spermicide makes cervical caps a lot better at preventing pregnancy. But the chemical in most spermicides, nonoxynol-9, has some risks. If you use spermicide many times a day, it can irritate your vagina and increase your risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. If you’re worried about the spread of STDs, use condoms along with your cervical cap and spermicide to protect yourself.

Some people or their partners might feel pain or discomfort when using the cervical cap. If you notice that your vagina feels sore or irritated after you use your cervical cap, it could be that you're sensitive to the spermicide or the material that the cervical cap is made of. You can try a different brand of spermicide and see if that makes a difference. If the irritation feels really bad or if switching brands doesn't help, talk to your doctor.

You should also talk to your doctor if:

your cervical cap feels uncomfortable

your vulva or vagina is sore, itchy, discolored, or swollen

you have discharge from your vagina that's different from your normal discharge

you keep getting bladder infections

These things may mean that something is wrong. Most problems are easy to treat, so don’t worry — just talk to your doctor as soon as you can.

Also watch out for signs of toxic shock syndrome. It’s extremely rare, but take your cervical cap out and call your doctor right away if you notice:

a sudden high fever

a rash that looks and feels like a sunburn

diarrhea or vomiting

a sore throat, aching muscles and joints

"What are the benefits of cervical caps?
","Cervical caps are portable, reusable, and hormone-free. They’re effective right away, and you can get pregnant as soon as you stop using it.

Cervical caps are convenient and give you control.
Cervical caps (and spermicide) are small and fit in your pocket or bag — wherever you go, your cervical cap can go with you! Your cervical cap is effective as soon as you start using it, and it’s easy to stop using it, too. If you decide that you want to try to get pregnant, just don’t put your cervical cap in before sex. Easy!

Cervical caps don’t interrupt sex.
You can put your cervical cap in before you have sex. Getting your pregnancy protection in place before things get hot and heavy means you don’t have to stop and worry about birth control in the heat of the moment.

Most people and their partners don't feel the cervical cap during sex. And knowing that you're protected from pregnancy can help you relax and enjoy sex more.

Cervical caps don’t have hormones.
Some people prefer non-hormonal birth control, or can’t use methods with hormones because of medical problems — cervical caps can be a good option for them.

Cervical caps last a long time.
Other barriers like condoms and sponges are disposable — you use it once and throw it away. But cervical caps only need to be replaced every year (with proper care). That means you can use them over and over — good for the environment and pregnancy prevention! A nurse or doctor should check the fit of your cervical cap after you’ve been pregnant (whether you gave birth, had an abortion, or had a miscarriage) — you’ll probably need a new size.

What are the disadvantages of using cervical caps?,"Cervical caps work best when used correctly every time you have sex, which is difficult for some people to do. Also, spermicide can have side effects.

You have to use it every time you have sex.
In order for your cervical cap to work as well as possible, you have to use it every time you have vaginal sex — and you have to use it correctly.

If you’re not sure that you’ll be able to use your cervical cap every single time you have vaginal sex, plenty of other types of birth control are easier to use and offer better protection against pregnancy — like IUDs and implants. You can explore different birth control methods  to find a method that’s best for you.

Remember: whatever kind of birth control you’re on, using condoms or internal condoms every time you have sex is the best way to lower your chances of getting STDs. And using condoms along with another birth control method also gives you extra pregnancy protection. Yay!

Cervical caps can be hard to use correctly.
Some people have trouble inserting their cervical cap, and it can take practice to get comfortable doing it.

Cervical caps can get moved out of place during sex if they get bumped around a lot.

Also, cervical caps don’t work as well if you don’t stay on top of the spermicide situation. You have to make sure you put your cervical cap-plus-spermicide in before sex, and leave it in for at least 6 hours after sex. If you have sex again while it’s in, you have to put more spermicide in your vagina. Don’t leave your cervical cap in for more than 2 days (48 hours).

Spermicide may have side effects.
If you use spermicide more than a few times a day, it can irritate your vagina and increase your risk of getting HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Learn more about the risks of spermicide.

If you notice that your vagina feels sore or irritated, you could be sensitive to the spermicide or the material that your cervical cap is made of. Talk to your doctor if your cervical cap or spermicide is causing you problems.

Size matters.
Cervical caps come in different sizes, and so do our bodies. Changes in your body over time can mess up the fit of your cervical cap. You have to get refitted for a new size if you have a baby, miscarriage, or abortion.

What are Fertility Awareness Methods?,"Fertility awareness methods (FAMs) are ways to track your menstrual cycle and fertile days so you can prevent pregnancy. FAMs are also called ""natural family planning” and “the rhythm method.”",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/fertility-awareness
"What are the different kinds of FAMs?
","Fertility awareness methods help you track your menstrual cycle so you’ll know about when your ovaries release an egg every month. This is called ovulation.

The days near ovulation are your fertile days — when you’re most likely to get pregnant. So people use FAMs to prevent pregnancy by avoiding sex or using another birth control method (like condoms) on those “unsafe,” fertile days.

There are a few different FAMs that help you track your fertility signs. You can use 1 or more of these methods to predict when you’ll ovulate:

The Temperature Method: you take your temperature in the morning every day before you get out of bed.

The Cervical Mucus Method: you check your cervical mucus (vaginal discharge) every day.

The Calendar Method: you chart your menstrual cycle on a calendar.

It’s most effective to combine all 3 of these methods. When used together, they’re called the symptothermal method.

The Standard Days Method is a variation on the calendar method. You track your menstrual cycle for several months to figure out if your cycle is always between 26 and 32 days long — you can’t use this method if it’s longer or shorter. Once you’ve established that your cycle is in the right range, you use another form of birth control (or don’t have vaginal sex) on days 8-19, which is when you’re fertile.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/fertility-awareness
How effective are fertility awareness methods?,"FAMs are about 77%–98% effective. That means 2–23 out of 100 couples who use FAMs will get pregnant each year, depending on which method(s) are used. If you use multiple FAMs together, they work even better.

The better you are about using FAMs the right way — tracking your fertility signs daily and avoiding sex or using birth control on “unsafe” days — the more effective they’ll be. But there’s a chance that you’ll still get pregnant, even if you always use them perfectly.

Fertility awareness methods don’t work as well as other types of birth control because they can be difficult to use. Want a more effective way to prevent pregnancy? Check out IUDs and implants. You can also pick what's important to you at the top of our birth control methods page, and we'll show you the methods that match.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/fertility-awareness
How can I make FAMs more effective?,"Like all birth control methods, FAMs are more effective when you use them as perfectly as possible. How well FAMs work also depends on both partners, so it’s important that each of you is supportive and learns how to use the methods.

FAMs are most effective when:

you work with a nurse, doctor, or counselor who knows FAMs well to learn how to use them correctly

you have the time and discipline to check your fertility signs and chart your cycle every day

you and your partner don’t mind avoiding vaginal sex or using another kind of birth control around your fertile days

The best way to use FAMs is to combine the temperature, cervical mucus, and calendar methods. Each of these methods relies on different signs to predict your fertile days, so using them together gives you the best picture of your fertility and makes FAMs more accurate. For example, keeping track of your cervical mucus pattern can be useful if your temperature chart gets messed up because you’re sick or stressed. And using more than 1 method may help you narrow down your fertile days, so you will have more safe days each month.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/fertility-awareness
What do I need to know about my menstrual cycle and fertility?,"In order to use FAMs, you’ve got to learn a lot about your menstrual cycle. You have to know when you’re most likely to get pregnant, and when it’s safe for you to have sex without risking pregnancy.

In order for pregnancy to happen, a sperm cell must join with your egg (this is called fertilization). During your menstrual cycle, there are certain days when it’s possible for sperm to fertilize an egg and cause a pregnancy — these are your fertile days.

Each month, your ovary releases an egg into your fallopian tube (this is called ovulation). Your egg is in your fallopian tube for about 12-24 hours. Sperm can hang out in your uterus and fallopian tube for up to 6 days after sex. If a sperm cell does join up with your egg in the tube, the fertilized egg travels from your fallopian tube to your uterus (womb) and can attach to the uterine wall, which starts a pregnancy. If your egg doesn’t get fertilized, it dissolves and you eventually get your period.

Since an egg lives about a day after ovulation and sperm live about 6 days after sex, you’re basically fertile for around 7 days of every menstrual cycle: the 5 days before you ovulate, and the day you ovulate. You can also get pregnant a day or 2 after ovulation, but it's less likely.
",http://plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/fertility-awareness
What is natural family planning or natural contraception? How do natural birth control methods work? ,"“Natural” family planning is when you track your menstrual cycle and ovulation to estimate what days you’re fertile, and then avoid unprotected penis-in-vagina sex on those days to prevent pregnancy.

There are a few ways to monitor your fertility for birth control — they’re called Fertility Awareness Methods (FAMs for short). Every day you take your temperature, monitor your cervical mucus, and/or chart your menstrual cycle to track your fertility signs. Using all 3 methods together works best, and it’s important to make sure you’re doing them every day.

FAMs are a great way to learn about your body, and they can be really effective if you have regular cycles and stay on top of tracking your fertility signs perfectly. Many people who use FAMs also like that there aren’t any side effects. But FAMs can also be difficult to use correctly, and won’t work well if you have an irregular menstrual cycle.

Sometimes when people talk about “natural” birth control, they mean a birth control method that doesn’t have hormones. If FAMs aren’t your thing but you want a super effective birth control method without hormones, check out the copper IUD. Condoms are another way to prevent pregnancy without hormones, with a great perk of also protecting against STDs. (Some people who use FAMs also use condoms on their fertile days.)",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/fertility-awareness
How do I use the temperature method (AKA basal temperature method)?,"Your body temperature naturally changes a tiny bit throughout your menstrual cycle. It’s lower in the first part of your cycle, and then rises when you ovulate. For most people, 96°– 98° Fahrenheit is their typical temperature before ovulation. After you ovulate, it goes up to 97°–99°F — about four-tenths of one degree higher than your usual temperature.

To use the temperature method (AKA basal temperature method), you must take your temperature the same way, at the same time, every single day — and write it on a fertility awareness chart. You can get fertility awareness method (FAM) charts from a nurse or doctor, your nearest Planned Parenthood health center, or a family planning clinic.In the beginning, you can ask your doctor or nurse to help you read your FAM chart. Soon, you’ll be able to read and understand it yourself. Wait until you’ve charted at least 3 months before relying on the temperature method (AKA basal temperature method) for birth control.

The temperature method (AKA basal temperature method) is more effective when you combine it with the other fertility awareness methods, like the cervical mucus method. Combining these methods is called the symptothermal method.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/fertility-awareness/whats-temperature-method-fams
How do I take my temperature?,"In order to track your temperature accurately, you have to do it as soon as you wake up, before you even get out of bed. Take your temperature before you talk, eat, drink, have sex, check your phone — take your temperature before you do ANYTHING. Keep the thermometer in place for about five minutes.  

The changes in your temperature will be really small — fractions of a degree — so get a special large-scale basal thermometer. Some basal thermometers are used in your mouth, and others are used in your rectum (butt). Rectal thermometers are usually more accurate and reliable.  You can buy a basal thermometer online or at most drugstores for about $10.

After you take your temperature, write it down on your chart. As you keep tracking your temperature, you’ll start to see a pattern. The changes in your temperature may happen quickly or slowly, and the pattern may be different from cycle to cycle.

Your temperature can change when you’re upset or don’t get enough sleep. Smoking, drinking alcohol, jet lag, being sick or stressed, and using an electric blanket can also mess with your normal temperature. Write stuff like this down on your chart to help you figure out when these changes in your temperature aren’t part of your natural menstrual cycle.

"What are the safe days to have sex when using the temperature method?
","Safe days begin after the increase in your temperature lasts for at least 3 days, and end when your temperature drops just before your next period begins. During your safe days, you can have unprotected vaginal sex. On your unsafe (fertile) days, avoid sex or use another method of birth control.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/fertility-awareness/whats-temperature-method-fams
How do I use the cervical mucus method?,"The hormones that control your menstrual cycle also make your cervix produce mucus — the gooey stuff on your cervix that comes out of your vagina as discharge. Your cervical mucus changes in color, texture, and amount during your menstrual cycle (especially around ovulation).

To use the Cervical Mucus Method to prevent pregnancy, you check out your mucus every day and write the results on a chart. The changes in your mucus help you figure out when you’re going to ovulate and are able to get pregnant. During your safe days, you can have unprotected vaginal sex. On your unsafe (fertile) days, either don’t have vaginal sex or use another method of birth control.

The Cervical Mucus Method is also called the ovulation method or the Billings method. It’s best to start this method with the help of an expert — like a doctor, nurse, or a family planning counselor — because it can be hard to learn on your own.
Don’t rely on the cervical mucus method for birth control until you’ve been charting your mucus for at least 1 cycle. The cervical mucus method is more effective if you use it with the temperature method (AKA basal temperature method). Using these together is called the symptothermal method.

Another type of cervical mucus method is called the 2-day method.

","You have to feel and look at your mucus (or discharge) every single day, and record what you notice on a special chart.  You can start tracking your mucus the day after your period stops completely.You can check your cervical mucus 3 ways:

Wipe the opening of your vagina (BEFORE you pee) with white toilet paper or tissue. Check the color and feel of the mucus.

Look at the color and texture of the discharge on your underwear.

Put clean fingers into your vagina, and then check the color and texture of the mucus on your fingers.

The best way to feel the consistency of your mucus is to rub it and pull it between your thumb and index finger. Record everything you notice about your mucus on a chart daily: your period days, dry days, wet days, sticky days, cloudy days, and slippery days.

When you first start charting your mucus, it’s best to avoid vaginal sex for 1 whole cycle (or use condoms). Sex can make your body produce more or different mucus, which can be confusing when you’re starting out.

What should my cervical mucus feel like?,"Your cervical mucus changes throughout the month, depending on where you are in your menstrual cycle:

During your period, the blood flow covers your mucus, so you won’t notice any. Days when you’re on your period are unsafe days.

Right after your period, you usually have 3-4 days without mucus and discharge. These are called “dry days,” and they may be safe days if your cycle is long.

Before ovulation is about to happen, your body makes more mucus as an egg starts to ripen. This mucus is usually yellow, white, or cloudy, and it feels sticky or tacky. You may notice it at the opening of your vagina for 3-5 days. These days are less safe.

Right before and during ovulation, you usually have the most mucus. It’s clear and it feels slippery — kind of like raw egg whites — and can be stretched between your fingers. These “slippery days” are your fertile (unsafe) days, when you’re the most likely to get pregnant. These unsafe, slippery days last about 4 days, leading up to (and including) when you ovulate.

After ovulation, you may suddenly have less mucus, and it’ll get cloudy and sticky again until it goes away and you have more dry days. This lasts for about 11–14 days. These cloudy, sticky, and dry days are all safe days. 

Then, your period starts and the cycle repeats.

","“Safe” and “unsafe” days vary from person to person and depend on the length of your menstrual cycle. During your safe days, you can have unprotected vaginal sex. On your unsafe (fertile) days, don’t have vaginal sex or use another method of birth control.

Safe Days

In general, you have one main phase of safe days: Safe days start after ovulation — when the most slippery mucus goes away and your discharge is cloudy and sticky and then goes away, leading up to your period. This lasts for about 11–14 days on average.

If you have a long cycle, the dry days that come right after your period may also be safe. (See the 2nd bullet above.)

Unsafe Days

In an average cycle, you have three main phases of unsafe days:

The days during your period are unsafe, especially if you have a short cycle. This is because you can’t know what your cervical mucus looks/feels like when it’s mixed with period blood.

Another unsafe phase comes a few days after your period ends but 2 or 3 days before the first signs of slippery mucus — while your body is making mucus that feels sticky or tacky. 

Unsafe days continue while your body creates slippery mucus leading up to ovulation. These unsafe, slippery days last for about 3-4 days. Unsafe days end about 4 days after slippery mucus peaks.

For example: if your shortest cycle is 26 days long, subtract 18 from 26 — you get 8. Then, count 8 days starting from day 1 (the first day of your period). If day 1 was on the 4th of the month, you’ll mark X on the 11th. So the 11th is your first fertile day of this cycle — you should stop having vaginal sex on this day or start using another method of birth control.

To predict the last fertile day in your current cycle:

Find the longest cycle in your record.

Subtract 11 from the total number of days in that cycle.

Count that number from day 1 (the first day of your period) of your current cycle, and mark that day with an X. (Include day 1 when you count.)

The day marked X is your last fertile day.

For example, if your longest cycle is 30 days long, subtract 11 from 30 — you get 19. Then, count 19 days starting from day 1. If day 1 was on the 4th of the month, you’ll mark X on the 22nd. So the 22nd is your last fertile day of this cycle — you can start having unprotected sex the next day.

The calendar method can only predict what are most likely to be safe and unsafe days — it can’t tell you for sure exactly when you’re fertile. So it’s hard to use if your cycles are not always the same length, and you can’t use it at all if all of your cycles are shorter than 27 days.

The calendar method is most effective when you combine it with other fertility awareness methods, like the temperature and cervical mucus methods.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/fertility-awareness/whats-calendar-method-fams

"How do I use the Standard Days method?
","You can only use the Standard Days method if:

To use the Standard Days method, you simply don’t have vaginal sex or use another method of birth control on days 8-19 of your cycle.


Most people using the Standard Days method use an app or have a special string of beads, called CycleBeads, that helps them keep track of their cycles. CycleBeads have 33 colored beads and a black rubber ring that moves from bead to bead.

",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/withdrawal-pull-out-method
What’s the withdrawal method (pulling out)?,"Pulling out is exactly what it sounds like: pulling the penis out of the vagina before ejaculation (aka cumming). If semen (cum) gets in your vagina, you can get pregnant. So ejaculating away from a vulva or vagina prevents pregnancy. But you have to be sure to pull out before any semen comes out, every single time you have vaginal sex, in order for it to work.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/withdrawal-pull-out-method
"Does pulling out protect against STDs?How can I make the pull out method work best?
","No. While withdrawal can prevent pregnancy, it doesn’t protect you against STDs. Some STDs, like genital warts and herpes, are spread through skin-to-skin contact. And STDs like chlamydia, syphilis, or gonorrhea can be carried in precum. So if you’re going to have sex, the best way to prevent STDs is by using condoms.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/withdrawal-pull-out-method
How can I make the pull out method work best?,"For withdrawal to work as well as possible, you must do it right every single time. Always. So always pull out BEFORE ejaculation, and always make sure to ejaculate (cum) away from your partner’s genitals. This is important because pregnancy can happen if even a little bit of semen gets in the vagina.

The best way to make the pull out method effective is to use it with another type of birth control (like the ring, pill, or condoms). This way, if there’s a slip up, you’re still protected.

Condoms are a great method to use with pulling out. Not only will they prevent pregnancy in case you don’t pull out in time, but condoms are the only way to stop the spread of STDs during sex. You can also practice withdrawal while using condoms to learn how to pull out in time.

Accidents happen. So if you use withdrawal for birth control, think about keeping emergency contraception (aka the morning-after pill) in your medicine cabinet, just in case ejaculate (cum) gets in or near your vagina. Emergency contraception can prevent pregnancy for up to 5 days after unprotected sex. The best way to make the pull out method effective is to use it with another type of birth control (like the ring, pill, or condoms). This way, if there’s a slip up, you’re still protected.

",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/withdrawal-pull-out-method
How effective is the pull out method?,"The better you are about using the pull out method correctly — keeping any ejaculation (cum) away from the vulva and vagina every single time you have sex — the better it will work to prevent pregnancy. For every 100 people who use the pull out method perfectly, 4 will get pregnant.

But pulling out can be difficult to do perfectly. So in real life, about 22 out of 100 people who use withdrawal get pregnant every year — that’s about 1 in 5.

The reality is withdrawal isn’t as effective as other types of birth control, but it’s definitely better than not using anything at all. And pulling out can be easily combined with other methods to give you extra pregnancy preventing power. Using withdrawal AND condoms together, for example, gives you pretty excellent protection against pregnancy.

If you use withdrawal for birth control, it’s a good idea to keep emergency contraception (aka the morning-after pill) around, just in case semen (cum) gets in or near your vagina. Emergency contraception can prevent pregnancy for up to 5 days after unprotected sex.

Want to use a more effective form of birth control? Check out the IUD and the implant. They’re the most effective kinds of birth control.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/withdrawal-pull-out-method/how-effective-is-withdrawal-method-pulling-out
What are the chances that I'll get pregnant using the pull-out method if I'm ovulating?,"There’s no way to know your exact chances of pregnancy in a particular situation. What we do know is that withdrawal works about 78% of the time overall. But the odds of pregnancy are always higher during the 5 days leading up to, and during, ovulation — these are called fertile days.

If no semen gets on your vulva or in your vagina, pregnancy can’t happen — whether or not you’re ovulating. But it’s sometimes hard for people to know if they pulled out completely before any semen (cum) came out. And some people may also have a tiny bit of sperm in their pre-cum. If sperm gets in your vagina during your fertile days, pregnancy is more likely to happen.

It’s also hard to know for sure exactly when you ovulate, even if you’re tracking your cycle. Many people’s cycles change from month to month. And lots of things (like stress or illness) can mess with your cycle and change the timing of ovulation.

The bottom line is, there are lots of different factors that can affect your chances of getting pregnant. If you’re really worried about preventing pregnancy, you might want to look into methods of birth control that are more effective than pulling out (like IUDs, the implant, the shot, or the pill). You can also use condoms along with pulling out — that way you’ll still be protected from pregnancy even if your partner doesn’t pull out in time (and you’ll be protected from STDs, too).",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/withdrawal-pull-out-method/how-effective-is-withdrawal-method-pulling-out
How do I use the pull out method?,"There’s only one step: pull your penis out of your partner’s vagina before any semen comes out. Your penis has to be all the way out before you ejaculate (cum), and then you have to ejaculate away from your partner’s vulva and vagina. This may sound simple enough, but it can actually be hard to do the right way all the time.

It takes practice to use the withdrawal method perfectly. Withdrawal also takes a lot of self-control. You have to be willing and able to stop having sex before ejaculating (cumming), which is usually when sex feels the best. And there’s no room for error — if any semen gets in the vagina or on the vulva, pregnancy can happen. So if you’re going to use the pull out method, keep emergency contraception (aka the morning-after pill) around, just in case you make a mistake.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/withdrawal-pull-out-method/how-does-the-withdrawal-method-pulling-out-work
When exactly am I supposed to pull out?,"It’s really important to pull your penis completely out of the vagina before any semen (cum) comes out. If you already started to ejaculate (cum) when you pull out, it’s too late. It’s also important to not get any semen on your partner’s vulva, so make sure you give yourself enough time to ejaculate away from your partner’s genitals. When it comes to withdrawal, it’s definitely better to be early than late.

In order to use the pull out method correctly, you have to know exactly when semen is going to come out of your penis. For most people, ejaculation happens when you start to have an orgasm. But everyone’s body is unique, and ejaculation may happen at different times for different people. It’s important to know your body and your sexual responses really well, so you can tell when you’re about to ejaculate and pull out in time. 

Getting the timing right for withdrawal can be a big challenge, especially for people who are young or haven’t had sex that many times. Masturbation can help you learn how to know when you’re about to ejaculate. You can also use condoms along with withdrawal, to get used to pulling out without risking pregnancy.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/withdrawal-pull-out-method/how-does-the-withdrawal-method-pulling-out-work
What are the benefits of the pull out method?,"The pull out method is a free, convenient, hormone-free way to prevent pregnancy — no trips to the doctor or pharmacy necessary.

It’s free and it’s always available.
One of the key reasons withdrawal is used is that it’s absolutely free and always an option. There’s nothing you have to buy and nothing you have to put in place before sex. Pulling out can be used by just about anyone, anywhere, at any time (though it may take practice to get it right). If you forgot your regular birth control or don’t have condoms on hand, the pull out method is always there if you need it. While it’s not the most effective method, it’s definitely better than using no birth control at all.

The pull out method has no side effects.
The pull out method is safe because it doesn’t have any side effects. But pulling out won’t protect you from getting an STD and it’s not the most effective way to prevent pregnancy.

Pulling out makes other forms of birth control even more effective.
Withdrawal works by keeping semen (cum) out of the vagina, which makes other forms of birth control even more effective. No matter what birth control you use, pulling out helps your method pack an even bigger pregnancy-preventing punch.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/withdrawal-pull-out-method/what-are-the-benefits-of-withdrawal
What are the disadvantages of the pull out method?,"Lots of people use the pull out method at some point in their lives, but it’s not as effective as many other methods and it can be difficult to do it correctly.

It’s hard to pull out in time.
The number one reason why the pull out method fails is because the penis isn’t pulled out before ejaculation (cumming). Many people plan on pulling out, and end up forgetting or changing their minds in the heat of the moment. You have to pull out right around the time those pleasurable sex feelings are the most intense, which many people aren’t willing to do when it comes down to it.

If you ejaculate inside your partner’s vagina, pregnancy is possible. Even if semen (cum) only gets on the outer genitals (vulva), sperm cells might swim into the vagina and cause pregnancy.

Certain people can’t use withdrawal effectively.
The pull out method is not a good way to prevent pregnancy if you experience premature ejaculation. Premature ejaculation is when you ejaculate (cum) before you’re ready or realize it’s going to happen. It’s really common, especially for younger people — but it also means it may be hard for you to use the withdrawal method.

Withdrawal is also not the best method if you can’t predict when, exactly, you’re going to ejaculate, if you’re sexually inexperienced, or if you don’t trust yourself to pull out at the height of sexual pleasure.

You need lots of self-control and trust to use withdrawal.
Self-control and trust are absolute musts for the pull out method. You need to have a healthy relationship, where both partners are equally committed to preventing pregnancy, to use withdrawal correctly.

If you’re the person with the penis, you need to know for sure when you’re about to ejaculate, and then you need to pull out before it happens, every single time. You also have to be willing and able to stop having sex and get your penis away from your partner’s vagina, right when you’re at the height of sexual pleasure.  If you don’t do these things, your partner could get pregnant. That’s a LOT of responsibility, so make sure you’re totally on board before relying on withdrawal for birth control.

If you’re the person with the vagina, you need to trust that your partner will pull their penis out in time, every time. If your partner doesn’t usually cooperate with using birth control or doesn’t want to prevent pregnancy, they may not use the pull out method correctly — which puts you at risk for unintended pregnancy.

It’s not always easy to practice withdrawal perfectly. That’s why it’s a good idea to look into using more effective methods like the IUD and the implant. They’re the most effective kinds of birth control. You can explore different birth control methods to find the best method for you.

And remember, emergency contraception (the morning-after pill) can help you avoid pregnancy in case there’s an accident and your partner doesn’t pull out in time.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/withdrawal-pull-out-method/what-are-the-disadvantages-of-withdrawal
"Is breastfeeding a form of birth control?How does breastfeeding prevent pregnancy?
","When you exclusively breastfeed — meaning you nurse at least every 4 hours during the day and every 6 hours at night, and feed your baby only breast milk — your body naturally stops ovulating. You can’t get pregnant if you don’t ovulate.

No ovulation means you won’t have your period, either. That’s why breastfeeding-as-birth control is also called the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM). “Lactational” refers to breastfeeding, and “amenorrhea” means not having your period.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/breastfeeding
How effective is breastfeeding as birth control?,"When you do it perfectly, the LAM birth control method can be about as effective as hormonal contraceptives (like the pill).  About 2 out of 100 people who use breastfeeding as birth control get pregnant in the 6 months it can be used after a baby is born.

Breastfeeding won’t prevent pregnancy if you feed your baby anything other than breast milk. So if you breastfeed but also use formula, LAM isn’t a great birth control method for you. It also doesn’t work if you use a breast pump — you need to nurse your baby if you want your breastfeeding to prevent pregnancy.

It’s important to remember that breastfeeding can only be used as birth control for the first 6 months of a baby’s life, or until your period returns. After that, breastfeeding is way less effective — especially as the baby begins to eat solid foods and sleeps longer at night. Be ready to use another birth control method at 6 months, when your period returns, or if you start feeding your baby food or formula.

How do I start using breastfeeding as birth control?,"You can start using LAM as soon as your baby is born. It may take a little while for you to get used to breastfeeding. Lots of people need help in the beginning, especially if it’s your first baby. Most hospitals have people who can help.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/breastfeeding
What are the benefits of using breastfeeding as birth control?,"Breastfeeding can prevent pregnancy and it can also provide many other benefits for both you and your baby.

LAM has lots of benefits for parents.
Breastfeeding is basically nature’s birth control. LAM is an easy, safe, and free way to prevent another pregnancy for up to six months. This can come in especially handy if you don’t want to deal with other birth control methods.

Here are some of the main benefits:

Once you begin nursing, it starts preventing pregnancy right away.

It’s free.

It’s safe.

You don’t need a prescription.

It doesn’t interrupt sex.

It reduces bleeding after you give birth.

Breastfeeding may reduce your chance of getting breast cancer.

Breastfeeding has lots of benefits for babies.
When it comes to a baby’s first months, there’s a reason a lot of people say “breast is best.” What’s good for you is also great for your baby:  

Breast milk gives your baby the best nutrition.

It’s full of beneficial antibodies that can help protect your baby from certain infections.

Studies have shown that breastfeeding reduces the risk of allergies and asthma.

Breastfeeding will enhance your bond with your baby by increasing body contact, and it can help soothe a fussy baby.

Breastfeeding decreases the chance that your baby will swallow germs in water, formula, or other liquids.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/breastfeeding/what-are-benefits-using-breastfeeding-birth-control
"What are the disadvantages of using breastfeeding as birth control?
","While LAM can be a great natural birth control method, it can also have drawbacks. It doesn’t last for a long time, and you must breastfeed around the clock for it to work.

It can be hard to breastfeed exclusively.
For breastfeeding to work as natural birth control, you have to breastfeed exclusively. That means nursing every 4 hours during the day, and every 6 hours through the night, which can be pretty difficult. It also means not feeding your baby formula or anything other than breast milk.

Even though breastfeeding is free, using it as birth control has other costs — like time and energy — that not everyone can afford. Being available every 4 hours to nurse can be tough.

You also need a strong nursing relationship (meaning your baby is really good at suckling) to use breastfeeding as birth control. Some studies have shown that weak suckling can make LAM slightly less effective. Using a breast pump won’t work for LAM, either — you’re only protected against pregnancy if your baby is nursing. And many people just have a hard time with nursing.

It’s totally okay if you can’t or don’t want to breastfeed exclusively — there are other ways to prevent pregnancy.

Breastfeeding only prevents pregnancy for up to 6 months.
Go ahead and breastfeed your baby as long as you like. But breastfeeding isn’t a long-term natural birth control method — you can only rely on breastfeeding to prevent pregnancy for the first 6 months of your baby’s life. Sometimes, you might get your period even before that. After you get your period or your baby is 6 months old, you’ll need another kind of birth control. Luckily, there are lots of options.

Breastfeeding can have some side effects.
Breastfeeding can lower vaginal lubrication (getting wet when aroused), which can make sex uncomfortable.

What’s the best birth control option while breastfeeding?,"Can I use hormonal birth control while breastfeeding?
Yes, if you’re breastfeeding, you can safely use hormonal methods. They won’t hurt you or your baby.

You can start using the shot, implant, Skyla and Mirena IUDs, and some types of birth control pills (called mini-pills) right after giving birth.

You may be able to get an implant or IUD in the hospital or at your postpartum checkup. Implants and IUDs are super effective, and prevent pregnancy for several years. Once these methods are in place, you don’t have to do anything (like remember to take a pill) to be protected from pregnancy. They’re set-it-and-forget-it birth control, which comes in really handy for busy new parents. You can use our birth control app to keep track of your insertion date and removal date. 

For the first 3 weeks after giving birth, don’t use a method that has the hormone estrogen, like the pill, patch, or ring.  After 3 weeks, you can start any of these methods.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/breastfeeding/whats-best-birth-control-option-while-breastfeeding
What non-hormonal methods can I use?,"You can safely use non-hormonal birth control while breastfeeding. For up to the first 6 months after your baby is born, you can rely on breastfeeding as birth control if you have not gotten your period yet and are not feeding your baby formula or food.  

The copper IUD is one of the most effective birth control methods out there, and it lasts for up to 12 years (but you can get it removed whenever you want). It’s a pretty convenient option if you don’t want to add birth control to the list of things you have to remember.

Other non-hormonal birth control options are condoms, internal condoms, diaphragm, and cervical cap.

If you used a diaphragm or cervical cap in the past, wait until your first postpartum checkup to begin using that method again. Most doctors recommend that you don’t put anything in your vagina until that first checkup. You may also need a new size.

You can also get your tubes tied (aka sterilization) after giving birth. But this method is permanent, so it’s only for people who are absolutely positive they don’t want any more kids.

What’s Abstinence and Outercourse?,"The definition of abstinence is when you don’t have sex. Outercourse is other sexual activities besides vaginal sex. Sexual abstinence and outercourse can mean different things to different people.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/abstinence-and-outercourse
How does Abstinence work?,"Abstinence means different things to different people. For most people, abstinence means not having sex with anyone. Sometimes people use abstinence as birth control to prevent pregnancy.

Abstinence prevents pregnancy by keeping semen away from the vagina, so the sperm cells in semen can’t get to an egg and cause pregnancy. If you’re abstinent 100% of the time, pregnancy can’t happen.

People sometimes only use abstinence to prevent pregnancy on days they’re fertile (most likely to get pregnant), but they may have vaginal sex at other times. This is called fertility-awareness.

Anybody can be abstinent, no matter your age, gender, sexuality, or the sexual experiences you’ve had before. People are abstinent off and on for reasons that may change over time, and a few are abstinent their whole lives. You can choose to be abstinent whenever you want, even if you’ve had sex before.

What are the different types of abstinence?,"For some people, abstinence means not doing ANY kind of sexual stuff with another person, including vaginal, oral, and anal sex.  

For other people, abstinence only means not having vaginal sex, but other sexual activities are allowed. You can decide what abstinence means to you. 

When it comes to preventing pregnancy, doing any or all sexual stuff besides vaginal sex is called “outercourse.”
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/abstinence-and-outercourse
How does Outercourse work?,"Many couples want to be sexual with each other without having vaginal sex and/or risking pregnancy. Outercourse prevents pregnancy the same way abstinence (and all other forms of birth control) do: by keeping sperm away from an egg.

Using outercourse as birth control means you do some sexual activities, but you don’t have vaginal sex (penis-in-vagina) or get any semen (cum) in the vagina. This way, the sperm cells in semen can’t get to an egg and cause pregnancy.

Some outercourse examples include kissing, massage, masturbating, using sex toys on each other, dry humping (grinding), and talking about your fantasies. There are lots of creative ways to get sexual pleasure from outercourse. But keep in mind that some kinds of outercourse can spread STDs if there’s skin-to-skin genital contact, or if your partner’s sexual fluids get on or in your genitals or mouth.

People may also choose to have oral sex and/or anal sex. Oral sex won’t lead to pregnancy, and anal sex doesn’t cause pregnancy either (unless semen spills out into the vagina). But both anal and oral sex can spread STDs — you can help prevent STDs by using a condom during anal sex, and condoms or dental dams during oral sex.

How effective is abstinence?,"If you never get semen (cum) on the vulva or in the vagina, pregnancy can’t happen. Abstinence is 100% effective as long as you’re actually abstinent. But if you do have unprotected vaginal sex — even just one time — pregnancy can happen.

Nobody’s perfect, and sometimes people plan on being abstinent but end up having sex. That’s why it’s a good idea to keep condoms around, just in case. Being prepared and having protection doesn’t mean you’re definitely going to have sex — it means you’re responsible and taking care of your health.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/abstinence-and-outercourse/how-effective-are-abstinence-and-outercourse
How effective is outercourse?,"Outercourse activities are 100% effective at preventing pregnancy: kissing, massage, masturbation, dry humping with clothes on, anal sex, and oral sex can’t cause pregnancy.

That said, pregnancy can happen, rarely, even if you don’t actually have vaginal sex. If semen (cum) accidentally gets on a vulva, sperm can swim up into the vagina and fertilize an egg.

There are a few ways this can happen:

Cum gets on the vulva. It can accidentally drip or be wiped onto the vulva.

There’s wet semen on someone’s fingers and/or sex toys, and they touch the vulva or go in the vagina.

Semen drips out of the anus and into the vulva after anal sex.

Bottom line: if you’re trying to avoid pregnancy, don’t get semen (cum) on the vulva or in the vagina. Pre-ejaculate (pre-cum) can also have some sperm in it, so keep pre-cum away from the vulva and vagina, too.

Do abstinence and outercourse protect against STDs?,"Abstinence is 100% effective at preventing the spread of sexually transmitted infections. If you don’t have any kind of sexual contact with another person, you can’t get STDs.

Sexually transmitted infections can be spread by touching genitals and sharing sexual fluids (like semen, pre-cum, and vaginal moisture). So there are a few ways outercourse can put you at risk for sexually transmitted infections:

Oral sex and anal sex spread most of the same STDs as vaginal sex. Use barriers like condoms and dental dams to help protect each other.

Swapping sexual fluids (like if you have semen on your hand and touch your partner’s genitals) can transmit STDs. You can use barriers like condoms, dental dams, gloves, and finger cots to help avoid contact with sexual fluids.

Touching your bare genitals together (dry humping) without clothes on can also spread certain STDs (like herpes and HPV), even if you don’t swap fluids.

Wearing underwear makes dry humping safer, but it may not prevent all skin-to-skin genital contact or keep sexual fluids away. And some STDs can live on areas that underwear doesn’t always cover (like your upper thighs or butt cheeks).

If you’re going to have outercourse but you don’t want to worry about STDs, avoid all skin-to-skin genital contact, and keep sexual fluids away from each other.

If you’re doing any activity that can pass STDs, get tested regularly. You can also use barriers like condoms, dental dams, and gloves to reduce your risk if you’re having the kinds of outercourse than can pass STDs — this is called “safer sex.”

","Practicing abstinence only works when both partners are cool with not having sex. So the key to making abstinence work is talking about it with your partner/boyfriend/girlfriend — especially because abstinence can mean different things to different people.

It’s important to be honest with each other and make decisions about sex together. Talking about sex, birth control, and abstinence might seem hard, but it’s one of the best ways to keep your relationship happy and healthy.

It’s normal to feel awkward or embarrassed, especially if you’ve never talked about sex before. Here are some tips to keep you on track:

Know what practicing abstinence means to you. Think about how far you feel comfortable going and what your sexual limits are. Once you know exactly how you feel and what you need, it’s easier to tell someone else about it.

Talk before things get sexual. It’s hard to think and speak clearly when you’re all turned on in the heat of the moment. So think ahead of time about how to say “no” to sex if it comes up. What words are best? What actions or body language will make it clear how you feel? It can help to practice what you’ll say out loud, and think about what your partner may say back.

Be straightforward. The talk doesn’t have to be long or complicated. Just be up-front and clear about what you want and what you’re comfortable doing.

Be confident. You have the right to decide when and if you have sex, and you can  say no to sex at any time, for any reason — even if you’ve already had sex before. (And if your partner doesn’t respect your limits, it could be a sign that your relationship isn’t healthy.)

Sex isn’t the only way to show your love and affection. People get to know each other, become close, and build trust by:

talking and listening

sharing

being honest

respecting each other's thoughts and feelings

hanging out together

Talking about sex doesn’t have to be a one-time thing that settles things forever — most couples have lots of talks about sex. Relationships change over time, and you and/or your partner may eventually have different feelings about sex and practicing abstinence.

If you want to start exploring sex with your partner, talk about birth control and/or sexually transmitted infections first. No matter what happens in your relationship, keep the conversation going and always be open and honest with each other.

"How do I talk to my partner about outercourse?
","There are lots of different ways to have outercourse, so it’s important to talk about what sexual stuff you’re comfortable with. It may feel kind of awkward at first, but it gets easier the more you talk. Here are some tips on outercourse:

Know what you want. Think ahead of time about what kinds of sexual things you want to do and don't want to do. Be confident in your choices — you have the right to say no to any kind of sexual activity, at any time, for any reason.

Put it on paper. If you’re having a hard time talking about what you want, you can write it down instead. Make a list of outercourse activities, and you and your partner can each mark down which ones you do want to do and don’t want to do.

Be super clear about your limits. Your partner can’t read your mind, so it’s important to be upfront about your feelings. And don’t assume anything about your partner — they should also be clear about what they want and don’t want. Set limits you both agree on and are comfortable with.

It’s okay to be nervous. If you’re feeling embarrassed, that’s totally normal. Let your partner know — chances are they feel the same way. It’s okay to admit that sex can be hard to talk about, and being honest with each other can make your relationship stronger.

Different is normal. You and your partner may have different desires. That’s totally okay, but it’s important to respect each other’s limits. It’s never okay to pressure someone to do something they’re not comfortable with. Stick to activities you both feel good about.

Keep the conversation going. Keep talking about your limits, likes, and dislikes. What feels good? What’s not working out?  It gets easier to talk about sex the more conversations you have, and it may even bring you closer together.

Outercourse is very unlikely to cause pregnancy, but some sexual activities can spread STDs. If you’re going to have oral and/or anal sex, get tested regularly and always use condoms and dental dams to help protect yourselves from sexually transmitted infections.

If you do decide to have vaginal sex, it’s important to protect yourself from both STDs and unintended pregnancy. Luckily, condoms and internal condoms help prevent both — and they’re inexpensive and easy to get. Even if you don’t plan on having vaginal sex, it’s a good idea to keep some condoms around to help keep you safe no matter what.

"What are the benefits and disadvantages of abstinence and outercourse?
","Abstinence and outercourse are safe, effective, and free ways to prevent pregnancy. But some people have a hard time avoiding sex.

Abstinence and outercourse have lots of benefits.
Both abstinence and outercourse are simple, free, and work really well to prevent pregnancy. In fact, abstinence is the only 100% effective way to avoid pregnancy. And outercourse really lowers your risk a lot.

There are other benefits of abstinence. People choose abstinence to:

wait until they feel ready for a sexual relationship

wait to find the right partner

enjoy their partner’s company without having to deal with a sexual relationship

focus on school, their job, or hobbies

follow their personal, moral, or religious beliefs and values

get over a breakup

heal from the death of a partner

follow their doctor’s advice during or after a sickness, infection, or medical procedure

Abstinence can be a way to avoid the risks that come with sex — like pregnancy and STDs — until you’re ready to prevent and/or handle them. Abstinence can also help you focus on other things in your life that are important to you, like friends, school, sports, activities, having fun, and planning for your future.

Outercourse has benefits, too. It can:

let you and your partner give each other sexual pleasure without causing pregnancy. And some types of outercourse (like masturbation or dry humping with clothes on) don’t spread STDs, either.

increase trust and closeness between partners

prevent pregnancy if you don’t have another kind of birth control available

help you better understand your (and your partner’s) body

help you learn how you (and your partner) like to be touched and what feels good
 

Abstinence and outercourse have some disadvantages.
While abstinence and outercourse are super-effective ways to prevent pregnancy and STDs, avoiding sex can be hard for some people. And if you plan on being abstinent but end up having vaginal sex, pregnancy can happen if you don’t use birth control.

Most people end up having sexual contact with another person at some point in their lives. That’s why it’s a good idea to always have a backup birth control plan, like keeping condoms around. And condoms are the only birth control method that also help protect you from STDs.

Outercourse can have some disadvantages, too. Some types of outercourse can spread STDs — like anything that involves skin-to-skin genital touching or sharing sexual fluids. And if semen gets on a vulva or in a vagina during outercourse, pregnancy can happen.

Many people find it hard to avoid vaginal sex when they’re doing other sexual activities. Sometimes people who are planning to use outercourse to prevent pregnancy don’t have a backup birth control method ready, just in case. If they get caught up in the heat of the moment and have unprotected sex, it can lead to pregnancy and spread STDs.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/abstinence-and-outercourse/what-are-benefits-and-disadvantages-abstinence-and-outercourse
What is a vasectomy?,"A vasectomy is a simple surgery done by a doctor in an office, hospital, or clinic. The small tubes in your scrotum that carry sperm are cut or blocked off, so sperm can’t leave your body and cause pregnancy. The procedure is very quick, and you can go home the same day. And it’s extremely effective at preventing pregnancy — almost 100%.

There are two types of vasectomies: the incision method, and the no-scalpel (no-cut) method. No-cut methods lower the risk of infection and other complications, and generally take less time to heal.

Vasectomies are meant to be permanent. You should only get a vasectomy if you’re 100% positive you don’t want to be able to get someone pregnant for the rest of your life.

The term “vasectomy” comes from the name of the tubes in your scrotum that are blocked during the procedure: vas deferens.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/vasectomy
How does a vasectomy work?,"Sperm — the microscopic cells that join up with an egg to cause pregnancy — are made in your testicles. Sperm leaves the testicles through two tubes called the vas deferens, and mixes with other fluids to make semen (cum). The sperm in your semen can cause pregnancy if it gets into a vagina.

A vasectomy blocks or cuts each vas deferens tube, keeping sperm out of your semen. Sperm cells stay in your testicles and are absorbed by your body. Starting at least 2 months after a vasectomy, your semen (cum) won’t contain any sperm, so it can’t cause pregnancy. You must have your semen tested 8-16 weeks after your vasectomy to make sure there’s no sperm in your semen. 

After your vasectomy, your semen (cum) will still look, feel, and taste the same. You’d have to look at it under a microscope to see a difference. You’ll still have the same amount of semen you did before —  there just won’t be sperm in it so you can’t get anybody pregnant. Vasectomies don’t change the way having an orgasm or ejaculating (cumming) feels, and they don’t impact your hormone levels, sex drive, or ability to get an erection (get hard).",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/vasectomy
Can a vasectomy be reversed?,"Vasectomies are meant to be permanent, so they can’t always be undone.

It’s sometimes possible to reverse a vasectomy, but there are no guarantees — your fertility may not come back. Vasectomy reversal is a complicated surgery, and it can be very expensive.

Whether or not a vasectomy reversal might work depends on:

How long ago you got the vasectomy.

The type of vasectomy you got.

The type of reversal procedure you get and the skill of the doctor.

If you’re worried about reversal when thinking about getting a vasectomy, it’s probably best to hold off.

Before you get a vasectomy, think about any possible life changes that could affect you in the future, like a divorce, a new partner, or the death of a child. You don't need your partner's permission to have a vasectomy — but it may be helpful to talk about it with your partner (or anyone else who could offer support and advice).

There are other ways to prevent pregnancy that aren’t permanent, like condoms, outercourse, and withdrawal. And your partner has lots of birth control options too. IUDs and implants are nearly as effective as vasectomies and last for a long time, but they’re not permanent.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/vasectomy
Is a vasectomy effective?,"A vasectomy is one of the most effective kinds of birth control out there, and THE most effective method for people with penises and testicles. Vasectomies are almost 100% effective at preventing pregnancy — but not right away. It takes at least 2 months for your semen to become sperm-free.

8-16 weeks after your vasectomy, your doctor will do a simple test called a semen analysis to check for sperm in your semen. Make sure that you ejaculate (cum) at least 20 times before you have your semen tested. For the test, you’ll masturbate into a cup or use a special condom when you have sex to collect a semen sample. Your doctor will tell you when there’s no sperm in your semen and the vasectomy is working as birth control. Don’t have unprotected sex until your doctor says it’s safe.

A vasectomy is really effective because it’s designed to be permanent, and you can’t forget to use it or mess it up. It prevents pregnancy round the clock for the rest of your life. So once your doctor says there’s no longer sperm in your semen, that’s pretty much it — you don’t have to do anything else to prevent pregnancy. Vasectomies are get-it-and-forget-it birth control.

There’s a very slight chance that the cut ends of your vas deferens can grow back together after a vasectomy, which means you could cause a pregnancy. But this is super rare.

",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/vasectomy/how-effective-vasectomy
Do vasectomies protect you from STDs?,"No, a vasectomy won’t protect you or your partners from sexually transmitted infections. Semen (cum) can still carry STDs, even if it doesn’t contain sperm. And for some STDs, all you need is skin-to-skin contact to get them from someone.

Use condoms to lower your chances of getting or spreading STDs.

Are vasectomies safe?,"Vasectomies are super safe, and very few people have complications. But like all medical procedures, there are some possible risks. The most common risks with a vasectomy are minor and treatable.

Can I get a vasectomy?,"Most people with penises and testicles can safely get a vasectomy. Your doctor will talk with you about your health to make sure a vasectomy is right for you.

You should only get a vasectomy if you’re totally sure you don’t want to be able to have kids for the rest of your life.

A vasectomy may not be a good choice for you if:

You may want to have a child biologically in the future.

You’re being pressured by your partner, friends, or family.

You hope a vasectomy will solve problems that may be temporary — such as marriage or sexual problems, short-term mental or physical illnesses, financial worries, or being out of work.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/vasectomy/how-safe-vasectomy
What are the risks of a vasectomy?,"Getting a vasectomy is usually really safe. But like all medical procedures, there can be some risks. Things like temporary pain, bruising, and infection are the most common ones. You may need an antibiotic from your doctor to treat an infection.

Call your doctor if  you get a vasectomy and have any of these signs of infection:

A fever over 100° F.

Blood or pus coming from where the cut was made in your scrotum.

Lots of pain or swelling in your scrotum or testicle area.

Other possible problems with vasectomies include:

Bleeding where the skin was cut (but this usually stops on its own).

Bleeding under the skin that may cause swelling or bruising (called hematoma). It usually goes away on its own. Putting ice packs on the bruise and taking over-the-counter pain medication can help.

Swelling (called Spermatic Granuloma) caused by sperm leaking from your vas deferens. It usually goes away on its own, but a doctor may need to drain it.

Temporary pain or discomfort are common. You can take over-the-counter pain medicine and wear supportive underwear that doesn’t let your testicles hang. Long-term pain is really uncommon, but possible. If this happens you should talk with a doctor or nurse for possible treatment.

Very rarely, the cut ends of your vas deferens grow back together, which can allow pregnancy to happen.

"Does getting a vasectomy hurt?
","Probably not. Your doctor will help make your vasectomy as comfortable as possible. You’ll get local anesthesia to numb your testicles, so you shouldn’t feel much during the procedure. You may also get medicine to help you relax.

You may have a little discomfort when you get the numbing shot or when the vas deferens tubes are handled during the procedure. But overall, you shouldn’t feel too much pain.

There are two types of vasectomies: one that requires an incision (a cut in your skin), and one that’s incision-free (no-scalpel or no-cut).
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/vasectomy/how-do-i-get-vasectomy
What happens during an incision vasectomy?,"The doctor makes one or two small cuts in the skin of your scrotum. Through these cuts, the tubes that carry sperm (vas deferens) are blocked off. Sometimes, a tiny part of each tube is removed. The tubes may be tied, blocked with surgical clips, or closed with an electrical current (this is called cauterizing). The whole thing takes about 20 minutes, and then the cut is stitched up.
",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/vasectomy/how-do-i-get-vasectomy
What happens during a no-scalpel vasectomy?,"The doctor makes one tiny puncture (hole) to reach both vas deferens tubes — the skin of your scrotum isn’t cut with a scalpel. Your tubes are then tied off, cauterized, or blocked. The small puncture heals quickly. You won’t need stitches, and there’s no scarring.

No-scalpel methods — also called no-cut or no-incision — reduce bleeding and lower the risk of infection, bruising, and other complications.

",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/vasectomy/how-do-i-get-vasectomy
How will I feel after my vasectomy?,"You can go home and rest right after your vasectomy. You may feel some discomfort or pain after your vasectomy, but you shouldn’t be in terrible pain. You may also have some bruising and/or swelling for a few days. 

After your vasectomy:

Wear snug underwear that doesn’t let your testicles move too much to help with pain.
Take over-the-counter pain medicine (like ibuprofen) to help with pain and swelling.
Ice your genitals as needed on and off for the first 24 hours to help with pain and swelling.
Don’t swim or take a bath for 2 days.
Don’t do any hard physical work or exercise for 1 week.
Don’t have any kind of sex or masturbate for 1 week.

It takes at least 2 months after your vasectomy for your semen to be sperm-free. Your doctor will test your semen 8-16 weeks after your vasectomy, and tell you when the sperm are gone and the vasectomy is working as birth control. Make sure to ejaculate (cum) at least 20 times before you have your semen tested.

How much does a vasectomy cost?,"Getting a vasectomy can cost anywhere between $0 and $1,000, including follow-up visits.

The cost of a vasectomy varies and depends on where you get it, what kind you get, and whether or not you have health insurance that will cover some or all of the cost. Vasectomies may be totally free (or low cost) with some health insurance plans, Medicaid, and other government programs.

Even if your vasectomy costs more than other methods up front, it usually ends up saving you money in the long run, because it lasts forever. Vasectomies are about 6 times cheaper than female sterilization.

",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/vasectomy/how-do-i-get-vasectomy
Can I get a vasectomy for free or at a low cost?,"Under the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare), most insurance plans must cover birth control with no out-of-pocket cost to you. This policy does NOT include vasectomies, but many insurance plans cover some or all of the cost of vasectomies anyway.

If you don’t have health insurance, you’ve still got options. Depending on your income and legal status in the U.S., you may be able to sign up for Medicaid or other state programs that can help you pay for birth control and other health care.

Planned Parenthood works to provide you with the services you need, whether or not you have insurance. Most Planned Parenthood health centers accept Medicaid and health insurance, and many charge less for services depending on your income. Other clinics and doctors that provide vasectomies may also use a sliding scale based on your income.

If you’re worried about cost, check with your local Planned Parenthood health center to find out if they can hook you up with a vasectomy within your budget. Planned Parenthood can also help you get health insurance.

",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/sterilization
"How does sterilization work?
","Every month, an egg leaves one of your ovaries (called ovulation). The egg moves through one of your fallopian tubes for a few days, waiting for sperm to fertilize it. Pregnancy happens if a sperm cell meets up with one of your eggs, and the fertilized egg implants in your uterus. When your fallopian tubes are blocked or removed after a sterilization procedure, sperm can't get to an egg and cause pregnancy.

During a sterilization procedure, you’re put to sleep so you won’t feel or remember anything. The doctor pumps gas into your belly so they can see your organs clearly. They make a small cut under your belly button and put a tiny camera inside your belly to find your fallopian tubes. Then they put a tool in through another small cut in your lower belly to close off your fallopian tubes. They’ll use heat, clips, or rings to seal your tubes shut, or remove your tubes altogether.

Tubal ligation procedures are done through incisions (cuts in your skin) in your belly. These are very low-risk surgeries, but any kind of medical procedure can have complications. The risks of sterilization procedures include:

bleeding

bad reaction to general anesthesia (medicine sometimes used to put you to sleep during the procedure)

infection, which is rare and can be treated with antibiotics

Very rarely, your bowel, bladder, uterus, or blood vessels can be injured, and you might need surgery to fix this.

Death caused by surgical sterilization is very, very rare — if it happens, it’s usually from a reaction to general anesthesia.

Your doctor will talk with you to help you figure out whether sterilization is safe for you.

"Is tubal ligation as safe as other types of birth control?
","Tubal ligation procedures are done through very low-risk surgeries where a doctor makes incisions (cuts) in your belly to permanently close, cut, or remove pieces of your fallopian tubes. Tubal ligation is very safe for most people and complications are rare. But any kind of medical procedure has risks. 

Another big thing to think about with tubal ligation: unlike most birth control methods, it’s meant to be permanent and usually can’t be reversed. So deciding to use tubal ligation as birth control is a big decision. 

There are other types of birth control that are reversible, long-lasting, and effective: the IUD and implant. These methods can last for up to 3-12 years, and you can stop using them at any time if you decide you want to get pregnant. 

Vasectomies are usually safer than tubal ligation. It’s easier to reverse a vasectomy than a tubal ligation, but both types of sterilization are supposed to be permanent and there’s no guarantee a reversal will work. 

Another thing to consider is cost — tubal ligation can be expensive to get. But most insurance plans fully cover tubal ligation with no out of pocket costs to you.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/sterilization/how-safe-tubal-ligation
How does tubal ligation feel?,"Your doctor will help make your procedure as comfortable as possible. You’ll get general anesthesia, so you’ll sleep through the procedure — you won’t feel or remember anything. After the surgery, you may have pain for a little while from the procedure itself and/or from the gas that was pumped into your belly. But most people recover within a couple of days.

What happens during a sterilization procedure?,"There are different kinds of sterilization. With a tubal ligation, the doctor will either block or remove small sections of your fallopian tubes. With a bilateral salpingectomy, the doctor will remove your tubes completely. There are a few different ways to do sterilization procedures.

Laparoscopy is the most common procedure. You’ll get general anesthesia to put you to sleep. The doctor pumps gas into your belly so they can see your organs. They make a few small cuts in your lower belly and use a laparoscope (a tool with a light and a lens) to find your fallopian tubes. Then they use heat, clips, or rings to close off your tubes or remove them completely. The whole thing takes about 20-30 minutes, and you can usually go home the same day. There’s very little scarring.

Another common procedure is a minilaparotomy. It’s often done right after childbirth. You get local anesthesia and your doctor makes a small cut near your belly button. The doctor brings your fallopian tubes up through the cut, then removes a short section of your tubes, blocks your tubes with clips, or removes the tubes completely. It usually only takes a few days to recover.

How will I feel after sterilization?,"You may have:

Tiredness or dizziness soon after waking up as the anesthesia is wearing off
Nausea
Mild pain in your belly or where your skin was cut
Cramps
Vaginal discharge or bleeding
Neck or shoulder pain (from the gas)
Most symptoms only last a short time. But call your doctor right away if you have:

A rash, swelling or trouble breathing
A fever of 100.4°F or higher
Severe, continuous pain in your belly that keeps getting worse or doesn’t get better with pain medicine
Unusual discharge or odor from your vagina
Dizziness or fainting spells
Pus, drainage, bleeding, redness, or swelling where any incision (cut) was made in your skin
Vomiting or nausea that doesn’t stop
Symptoms of pregnancy

How long will it take me to recover after my sterilization?,"Your recovery depends on your general health and how your body reacts to surgical procedures.

You can usually recover from sterilization within a couple of days, but it’s a good idea to take it easy until you feel better. Avoid lifting anything heavier than 12 pounds for a week after the surgery if you can.

If you have stitches, they’ll either dissolve on their own or your doctor will have to take them out later. Your doctor will let you know if you need to come back to get your stitches removed.

How soon can I have sex after sterilization?,"Talk with your doctor about when it's safe to start having sex again. Sterilization starts preventing pregnancy right away, but wait until you feel healed and ready to have sex.

How much does tubal ligation cost?,"Tubal ligation can cost between $0 to $6,000, including follow-up visits.

The cost of a tubal ligation varies and depends on where you get it, what kind you get, and whether or not you have health insurance that will cover some or all of the cost. Tubal ligation may be totally free (or low cost) with some health insurance plans, Medicaid, and other government programs.

Even if tubal ligation costs more than other methods up front, it usually ends up saving you money in the long run because it lasts forever. Vasectomies (aka male sterilization) are usually a lot cheaper than female sterilization.

If you’re worried about cost, check with your local Planned Parenthood health center to find out if they can hook you up with birth control that fits your budget.

"Can I get free tubal ligation?
","There’s a good chance you can get a tubal ligation for free (or at a reduced price) if you have health insurance. Because of the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare), most insurance plans must cover all methods of birth control with no cost to you, including some female sterilization procedures. Learn more about health insurance and birth control.

If you don’t have health insurance, you’ve still got options. Depending on your income and legal status in the U.S., you may be able to enroll in Medicaid or other state programs that can help you pay for birth control and other health care.

Planned Parenthood works to provide you with the services you need, whether or not you have insurance. Most Planned Parenthood health centers accept Medicaid and health insurance, and many charge less for services depending on your income. Contact your local Planned Parenthood health center for more information.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/sterilization/how-do-i-get-tubal-ligation-procedure
Where can I get a tubal ligation?,"You can get a tubal ligation at a doctor’s office, hospital, or health clinic. Many Planned Parenthood health centers also do some types of sterilization procedures. If your local Planned Parenthood doesn’t do tubal ligation, they may be able to refer you to other health care providers in your area who do.

Some choose to get sterilized right after giving birth or having an abortion. Talk with your doctor ahead of time if you want to combine sterilization with another procedure.

Depending on where you live, there may be age restrictions or waiting periods to get a tubal ligation. You can ask about these when you call to make an appointment.

"What are the benefits of sterilization?
","Sterilization is VERY effective.
Tubal ligation is permanent and one of the most effective kinds of birth control out there — more than 99% effective at preventing pregnancy. Tubal ligation works so well because it’s permanent, and there’s almost no way you can mess it up or use it the wrong way. It protects you from pregnancy 24/7 for the rest of your life.

Sterilization is convenient.
After you get sterilized and the doctor says it’s safe for you to have sex without birth control, that’s pretty much it — you never have to use birth control again. No trips to the pharmacy, nothing you need to buy, and you don’t have to put anything in place before sex. Sterilization is get-it-and-forget-it birth control.

Sterilization doesn’t change your hormones.
Some people prefer non-hormonal birth control, or can’t use methods with hormones because of medical problems. Tubal ligation doesn’t use hormones to prevent pregnancy. It won’t cause menopause, change your periods, or mess with your natural hormones.

Sterilization can make your sex life better.
Sterilization is birth control that you don’t have to use during sex, so it won’t interfere with the action. You can get caught up in the heat of the moment without worrying about pregnancy, and you and your partner can focus on each other instead of birth control.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/sterilization/what-are-benefits-sterilization
"What are the disadvantages of tubal ligation?
","Sterilization is permanent.
Sterilization is meant to be permanent. Getting a sterilization reversed is really expensive, complicated, and it doesn't always work — your fertility may never come back.

You should only get sterilized if you’re totally certain you never want to get pregnant for the rest of your life. Read more about sterilization reversal.

If you want super-effective, long-lasting birth control that’s reversible, check out IUDs and the implant.

Sterilization can have some risks.
Overall, tubal ligation is very safe, and most people don’t have any problems. But all medical procedures have some possible risks. You may have some pain and discomfort during and after the procedure, and some of the rare risks of tubal ligation can be serious. Read more about tubal ligation safety.

Sterilization doesn’t prevent STDs
Sterilization doesn’t prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections. Use condoms to protect yourself from STDs.",https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/sterilization/what-are-disadvantages-tubal-ligation
